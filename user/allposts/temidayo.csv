When you are raised by a full blooded Nigerian woman, you will know that it is not easy to eat outside your home, you feel in convenient because the food you will eat outside your home will be different from what you will prepare yourself at home.

Perhaps it was a divine arrangement. Perhaps it wasn't. I didn't know what to believe. It was in my bid to catch some sleep that hush tones wafted Inyo my ears. 
""Fred, "" it was my mother's voice. ""Please give me some more time. I don't want to make another mistake again. The last one claimed the life of one of my sons...""

My mother was talking on the phone. Because she was driving and thought I was sleeping, she had the phone speaker.

My girl is one in a million, she is my peace and my heart beat.
Even while we do not have enough money, cars, peace and all we want to our desire,
She did not leave me for all this reasons,
when a wealthy man came to ask for her hand in marriage,
She turned him down and told him that she will never leave me alone,
I was surprised to see that she left all of those enjoyment, life of luxury and satisfaction,
just to be with me and have me by her side forever,
Join me to celebrate my queen,
Because I have found none like her,

Humors: This is another type of fiction that describes a funny experience, it is the ability of the play to make people laugh.

 Sometimes they have an idea that it is the male child that will enable the continuity of the families name, since names are passed on from generation to another.

However, the things that old people regret that they have not done is usually different as the ways they have lived is as well different.

Some people wish they have taken some necessary risks when they were young.

Some of those who do not have the money believe that you should work hard to get it.

Some others who do not have it at all believe that their destiny does not just want them to have lots of money, so they are satisfied with the little that they have.

Handshakes have been a major of greeting, agreement and showing respect. A handshake can be initiated by either party but it is preferable if the older or senior initiates it. You do not expect to visit your father-in-law and stretch your hand for a handshake first, it will be rude and insulting for an African man.

When shaking someone, the ‘web’ between your thumb and first finger should meet firmly with the other party. While you shake hands, you are supposed to look directly at the eyes of the other party. If you were walking before, stop and take a turn to face the person, then have a proper handshake.

If you are meeting someone for the first time, your greeting should as well include the introduction of self -such as my name is....... and I am really pleased to meet you.

She got up from her bed and replied: Mama, please make it snappy because I need to rest.
Her mother ignored her disrespectful statement and said; I know you are very beautiful my darling and I am very proud of you, whenever I pass by and I listen to people's compliment about your great beauty I feel really proud to be called your mother, but my darling I want you to know that beauty is vain and as time goes on you will get old and all this  ","{""tags"":[""village"",""champion"",""nigeria"",""story"",""africa""],""image"":[""https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3r290UqKho8/hqdefault.jpg""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=imgres&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwion9P0nafWAhUExRQKHaHPALAQjRwIBw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3r290UqKho8&psig=AFQjCNF1FaRssO9GGnoO5P2fLDdENI-XXw&ust=1505566364610193""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-09-15 12:57:36,The Local Champion,/village/@temidayo/the-local-champion,0

I realized however that competition has got it's two sides which involves healthy and unhealthy competition.

When you compete in an unhealthy way, it means that you could hurt people in order to acquire power and get your self satisfied. People who compete in such a manner are usually greedy people who do not care about the downfall of others.
Unhealthy competition makes others feel bad and unsafe.

I started brushing my teeth, I brushed it so hard because I was going to an office. My brother might not be bothered about how I dress up but I also wanted to be respected by his employees. Finally I took my bath and started going to the office.

 As a child he would always work his spirit and soul just to make money into his pocket. Nobody knew why he was doing the jobs then, but I think the job really paid him.

I laid on my bed rolling from one end to the other as I thought about my recent predicament. I thought about how my twin brother Denis had acquired such wealth. I was so deep in thought I did not know when the power holding company restored the light. Immediately I came to consciousness the power went and I became more depressed.

He was earning #10,000 monthly but uses #6,000 for transportation and feeding. At the end of the day, he is left with #4,000 which is not even enough to solve his financial problems from clothing to feeding and offsetting depts.

How do you take your finance, I grew up in a house where we were thought to always keep money so we could have something to spend in future. I did not really see it as a relevant thing, I enjoyed going out and paying with the boys. I would go out and play games while my brother would go and work for someone, he would wok till he was tired of walking. 

He started saving since he was a child, while I kept on spending money the way I liked on games. When my brother was 18, he got a car for himself while I could barely get a bicycle for myself.
