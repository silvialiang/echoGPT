A lot of people in my area even more than they understand always like to use the phrase: ‘’Time is money’’ and it could also mean that if you are not able to properly analyse your time and understand how necessary time is, you may never be able to understand the value and maintenance of money too.

Maybe you did. Anti-trust rules are meant to help smaller businesses have a fair ground to compete instead of a company controlling the market. It is very rear to see a single company in a particular industry but some companies become relatively monopolist because they have become too big that other companies can’t compete with them on a fair ground.
