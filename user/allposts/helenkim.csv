# What causes global warming?

global warming are cause when carbon dioxide  and other air pollutants are collected into the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface. Radiation will escape into space but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. That's what's known as the greenhouse effect.

# Greenhouse effect

Greenhouse effect is the warming that happens when certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat. These gases let in light but keep heat from escaping, and this could lead to global warming.
