Hello everyone, and welcome to my journal. Since this is not my diary where I will write my daily activities but my journal, I will be sharing from the heart.

I am a young lady who is just 23 years old, and I know I have a long year ahead to accomplish my heart's desires. I finished from Akure College of Health, studying health science, but this doesn't qualify me to be a medical doctor or nurse in my country. I have had the desire to help as a medical practitioner but then it goes beyond hope, it has to do with putting in the effort.

It is widely understood that excessive alcohol consumption leads to intoxication. This fact is not limited to alcoholics alone. Prolonged and excessive alcohol intake can potentially cause damage to the liver. However, it's important to note that alcohol doesn't only affect the liver; it impacts various organs throughout the body, including the lungs, heart, spleen, kidney, esophagus, pancreas, stomach, and even skeletal muscles.

In the ever-evolving world of work, traditional 9-5 office jobs have been eclipsed by a surge in online work and remote businesses. While these new opportunities offer convenience and flexibility, they also pose significant health risks, particularly from the sedentary lifestyle they encourage. Scientists have sounded the alarm on the dangers of prolonged sitting, likening it to well-known health hazards such as obesity, smoking, and excessive drinking. In this post, we'll explore the implications of extended sitting on our health and discover ways to mitigate its impact. Let's have fun reading this post as I will be discussing sitting and our health. There is a likelihood that you are sitting as you are reading this.

As humans, our bodies have evolved a remarkable defense system to combat harmful invaders and pathogens. One of the most powerful weapons in our immune arsenal is the complement system. Comprising over 30 serum proteins and regulatory cell membrane components, this complex system collaborates to neutralize intruders and protect our well-being. Activated by antibodies, the complement proteins play a crucial role in crippling invaders, activating the immune system, and perforating the cells of attacking organisms.

The complement proteins cripples invaders, activate the immune system and perforates the cells of the invading organisms. Remember that they are proteins, so their shapes are programmed to interact with certain things. Different proteins are able to perform differently to get the desired result. The complement system is made up of different pathways including the alternative pathways, classical pathway, lectin pathway, and, terminal pathway.

We all eat, and some of us love eating more than others. While some people are good with eating at once, others love eating in bits for an extensive period of time. Either way, we all eat, and in the process, we must have overeating at some point in time. It is no doubt that people like myself like to watch our intake, so they do not start to regret while we ate the food in the first place, but then there are cases when it is glaring that we have overeaten.

Overeating has to do with the consumption of excess food compared to the amount of energy to be released by the organism. It has to do with eating food more than 1 litre which is the volume of the stomach, leading to abdominal discomfort, nausea, and extreme fatigue. Continuous eating in this manner can lead to obesity, and be regarded as an eating disorder. Over time, it can be fatal if not controlled. This said, let's take a look at the normal events that happen when a person overeats.

I am not a storyteller, but let me tell you a story as I begin this post. Actually, it isn't going to be a story all through as I will be discussing about the topic as well but you know they say good storytellers are good writers. So let's bring science and story together.

Ben woke up feeling with a fever, he feels there is something wrong with his body system. He is feeling sick to the stomach and so he decided to drive to the hospital to see the doctor so he can give him a pill or prescription so he can take and get over this sick feeling. Explaining to the doctor how he felt from body pain, cramps, and diarrhea, which accompanied the fever. He just wants an antibiotic that will deal with those bedeviled bacteria but then the doctor decides to run a blood and urine test instead and tells Ben that he might be suffering from a viral infection.

Can one's body truly become so massive that a crane or bulldozer is needed to shift from place to place? Surprisingly, yes. But this extraordinary condition arises from a combination of two key factors: a sedentary lifestyle and excessive eating. Obesity doesn't appear overnight; it gradually takes shape over time. Instances of individuals who've fallen into this predicament due to inactivity and overconsumption are well-documented and notable cases include Paul Mason, Carol Yager (whose life was cut short due to multiple organ failures stemming from extended edema), and Manuel Uribe (whose demise was linked to obesity, heart ailments, and liver damage).

So many people do not perform any form of exercise coupled with the fact that the type of job they do is one that requires them to stay indoors or not move all day. It can be so fun when you just sit at home, work, then watch the TV, and place orders for whatever you want to eat but you see, this type of lifestyle can come with d","{""image"":[""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/At_the_beach_-_male_abdominal_obesity.JPG"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:At_the_beach_-_male_abdominal_obesity.JPG"",""https://creazilla-store.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/cliparts/22317/man-eating-obesity-clipart-md.png""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""health"",""stemng"",""ocdb"",""neoxian"",""stemgeeks"",""proofofbrain"",""waivio"",""cent"",""alive""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.35-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[""1.4988"",0,""1.2520""]}",2023-08-09 02:35:39,Sedentary Lifestyles and Their Health Consequences,/hive-196387/@thomisin/sedentary-lifestyles-and-their-health,7

Let me make this crystal clear: Once you hit your early twenties, you start losing 1% of your collagen every year. Collagen, as we all know, is the secret behind skin strength, suppleness, and that coveted youthful glow. As the years roll on, collagen levels plummet, and our skin begins to show those telltale signs of aging – wrinkles. This is where the influencers swoop in, ready to make a fortune off your desire to defy time, peddling anti-aging creams that promise miracles. But let me share some insights to help you navigate this maze.

In other to understand skin cream, you must understand the skin itself, which is the largest organ in the body. The hypodermis the innermost layer of the skin, and it holds the sweat gland, fat gland, and the base of the hair follicles, The dermis is the next part and it contains collagen fibers, and sebaceous glands that secretes natural oils.

Undoubtedly, we all experience the cycle of going to bed at night and waking up the next day, unless, of course, you're one of the unfortunate individuals suffering from insomnia. Many people grapple with sleep issues and actively seek ways to improve their sleep quality. So, what can we do to enhance our sleep?

First, a significant number of us lead sedentary lives, rarely engaging in any form of exercise, despite its well-established benefits for our overall health. It's worth noting that a lack of physical activity can impede a good night's sleep. Numerous studies and research have demonstrated that daytime exercise can facilitate falling asleep faster and enhance the overall quality of sleep. Even as little as 10 minutes of exercise can help mitigate certain sleep problems, such as Sleep Apnea. However, it's crucial to avoid vigorous exercise within a couple of hours before bedtime, as it can lead to the release of endorphins and a rise in body temperature, potentially leadin","{""image"":[""https://images.pexels.com/photos/3771069/pexels-photo-3771069.jpeg"",""https://live.staticflickr.com/17/20371510_31618d9c8d_b.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemng"",""stem"",""proofofbrain"",""neoxian"",""waivio"",""cent"",""ocdb"",""alive"",""bee""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.36-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[0,0]}",2023-08-29 01:11:15,Want to Have Good Quality Sleep?

Not being able to get to sleep at the right time is one problem that people with ADHD complain about. A 2008 study showed that about 70% of kids with ADHD diagnosis have issues falling asleep, and when they do, they have issues staying asleep. Adults with ADHD have shown a 78% delay in the circadian rhythm which causes them to have delayed activities like sleeping and waking, and they even sleep for a very short amount of time.

**Dairy Milk: Not So Green**

Dairy milk has been a staple for generations, but it's not known for being environmentally friendly. The production of dairy milk is associated with emitting three times more greenhouse gases than most milk alternatives. It also demands approximately nine times more land due to the cultivation of animal feeds and land required for dairy cattle. Moreover, dairy milk production consumes a substantial amount of water, making it less sustainable when considering eco-friendliness.

This is a legitimate possibility for over 7% of he human population, and it is known as sleep paralysis. So in this post, I will be writing about what happens to the body during sleep paralysis.

Sleep paralysis falls under the umbrella of sleep disorders known as Parasomnia, sharing space with other disorders like Sleepwalking, Nocturnal Seizures, and night terrors. Specifically, sleep paralysis is categorized as a rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnia. Understanding REM sleep is crucial, as it's the stage where dreams unfurl with rapid eye movements beneath closed eyelids.

On the fateful night of July 27, 2020, a man experienced a chilling encounter that would turn his peaceful dwelling into a semi-horror scene. Awaking in the dark hours, he found a bat within the confines of his home. The eerie episode took a terrifying turn when the bat unleashed screeches and sank its teeth into the man's hand. What followed was the onset of symptoms that hinted at a disease notorious for its severity, and that disease is rabies.

When it comes to diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans, Rabies hold a high position when it comes to severity of manifestation. From Foxes, Dogs, Bats, and to getting it from organ transplant, Rabies has found its way into the live of many, and it is not a joke, trust me when I say it.

In the 17th century, Anton Van Leeuwenhoek and Robert Hooke used microscope to identify cells as the basic unit of life. Today, we know that all organisms are made up of cells. While cells can differ from one another, one thing is clear that all cells no matter their look have membranes. Living organisms are very unique, and they almost do not follow second law of thermodynamics that states that heat does not naturally flow from a cool body to a warmer; work must be expended to make it do so.

Depending on the hospital at which you work, or the country where you live, there is a code for emergency cases where patients are losing blood and require blood immediately. In some countries it is regarded as Code Omega, while some call it code orange. Depending on the country and the codes used, there are cases where patients are rushed into the hospital and will require blood transfusion as soon as possible as the patients survival depends on giving them blood as soon as possible.

When this code is given in a hospital, the blood lab will immediately begin work, sending one package/pint of blood after another depending on the amount needed. At this point, every seconds count when talking about delivering the blood to the patient, also, giving the patient the right type of blood matters a lot, and that depends on the blood type available. Any mistake with this blood is a factor between life and death.

Ever wondered why doctors carefully examine your hands during a check-up? Much like your eyes and tongue, your hands can provide valuable clues about your health and potential underlying conditions. Let's delve into some telltale signs that your hands might reveal about your well-being.

Let me start with Arachnodactyly, and this can be confirmed in people whose thumb finger overlaps when holding a fist, or whose thumb and pinky finger overlap when holding the wrist. This is a sign that your fingers are long, and the name comes from its similarity with spider fingers. This type of finger is common with people with Marfan syndrome as they possess long fingers and arm span compared to their height. This is a genetic mutation and it can affect elastic fibers in other organs which can lead to pneumothorax causing the collapse of the lungs without any warning.

Continuing on this fascinating journey, let's explore the intricate movements of the tongue and unravel the silent messages it conveys about our well-being. Before we delve into the health implications, let's assess the agility of our tongues.

The tongue can move in 5 ways, which includes rolling, cloverleaf, folding, and twisting left and right. While most people can role, cloverleaf is the most difficult while only about 5% of people can do the entire 5 tongue movement. Since you learned that already, let's discuss your tongue and what it says about your health.

This is possible by allowing the drug to target the structures of the microorganism's cells through their mechanisms which is different from ours like for instance, bacteria have cell walls but our cells don't have cell walls, we also have different materials in our nucleic acids, ribosome, and cell membrane.\

We discussed the Kayser-Fleicher ring, a golden brown ring around the iris associated with copper buildup in conditions like Wilson disease. Today, we continue our journey through the eyes, focusing on another type of ring that can appear in the iris, as well as other eye indicators of our health.

A Corneal Arcus occurs when cholesterol deposits in the eye, and this what causes the white or gray ring around the iris. It isn't like the ring damages the eye as it is common with people who are aged but when in young people, it could be as a result of conditions such as Familial hypercholesterolemia where cholesterol is deposited in different parts of the body including the eyelids, and tendons.

You hear words like the heart is the window to your soul, or the gateway to an opened mind. Well, I do not know about that, but on thing I am certain about one thing, the eye can tell a lot about how you are doing and how healthy you are.

First and foremost, the white part of your eye, known as the sclera, should ideally remain white, indicating good health. However, when the entire sclera turns yellow, it's a sign of a condition called Scleral Icterus that should not be overlooked. This yellowing suggests an elevated level of bilirubin in the body. Normally, red blood cells have a lifespan of about 120 days or 4 months, after which they break down to produce bilirubin, which the liver processes.

Wounds are an inevitable part of our human experience, given that our skin is a fleshy and vulnerable barrier. The skin, our body's largest organ, plays a crucial role in protecting our vessels, blood capillaries, and internal organs. It acts as a shield against external elements, such as sunlight and pressure, and enables us to perceive sensations like warmth and pain.

In doing our daily activities and trying to survive, the skin would experience cuts, burns, scrapes, bruises and so on, and one thing we want is healing, we want our wounds to heal up, creating scar tissues and allowing us to do our other activities. While the body can heal up by itself, there are cases where it will not be able to do this by itself, and would require bandages to help treat the wound and with modern research with microbiology, and bio-engineering brought about electric bandages.

About 80% of all adults have taken alcohol at one point in their lives, and a lot of people cannot do without the beverage, making it the beverage to unwind but then, alcohol is a drug that decreases neuronal excitation in the brain and releases Acetaldehyde and other byproduct that impacts the body.

So many people take alcohol in the morning, while some other people take it at night. Some people have argued that it is not a good time to take alcohol at night, while some believes that taking it at night before going to bed is the best.

Humans are a remarkable amalgamation of countless cells, with the average person boasting an astounding 30 trillion cells, complemented by an additional 40 trillion bacteria thriving within our digestive tract. Although our bodies consist of trillions of cells, they do not always operate in perfect harmony to sustain our well-being. Within this intricate symphony of cellular activity, some cells seem determined to seize nutrients for themselves, often taking the form of mutated cells that defy regulation and continue to proliferate. These rogue cells, aptly known as cancer cells, persistently expand and endeavor to develop tumors. It's a continuous struggle within our bodies, with one cell or another occasionally going rogue. However, our bodies have evolved robust defense mechanisms to counteract such deviations.

Let's take a journey back in time to explore the origins of this critical discovery. It was in 1964 when the President of the American Cancer Society first uttered those fateful words, but the journey to that moment was a complex one.

There was a report published in the same year titled Smoking and Health that explained how smoking caused lots of diseases and since then, there have been different labels on cigarettes and you must have seen a lot of them, depending on the country you live in. In the 50s, there were a lot of studies pointing to a link between smoking and cancer but how did we get to that conclusion?

Instead of radiating her usual positivity, she appeared to be in pain, the result of an unfortunate encounter with a nail. Her distress was compounded by her deep-seated fear of needles, nails, and anything sharp with a pointed tip. In this case, she had just received a Tetanus injection, and the ordeal had left her trembling. She made a statement that if it was a needle, it could have been worse because it could get lost in her foot.

Heart attack is caused by atherosclerosis or plaque buildup in the arteries. Where there are arteries that supply blood to the body, the heart has its own arteries known as the coronary artery. Its job is to deliver blood and oxygen to the heart itself. Remember that the heart is a working muscle that works from the day you are born till the day you die, and a heart attack occurs when the coronary artery is blocked stopping oxygen, and blood from getting to the heart.

The battle against cancer has long involved the use of chemotherapy, a powerful treatment that aims to disrupt the metabolic activity within cancer cells, ultimately leading to their demise. However, while chemotherapy has proven effective in combating cancer, its side effects have made it a challenging option for many patients. In this video, we delve into the world of cancer treatment, exploring the nuances of chemotherapy and the evolving landscape of targeted therapies.

Chemotherapy has been a lifesaver for a lot of cancer patients, and it is the use of drugs to treat cancer. With Chemo, a patient can get one or a combination of different drugs to tackle the cancer. Its use also depends on what it is expected to do, as some would kill the cancer cells completely, while others would make it easy for surgical procedures to be possible. There are also times when a chemo is done to manage patient symptoms when a cure isn't visible.

The importance of sleep is widely recognized, as it rejuvenates our bodies and minds, fortifies our mental well-being, and significantly contributes to our overall health. Yet, the grasp of sleep deprivation can be relentless, stemming from a multitude of factors that disrupt our restful nights.

At its core, sleep deprivation often arises from a myriad of origins. It can be a consequence of medical conditions such as insomnia, depression, or other disorders that intricately affect our ability to fall and stay asleep. However, it is crucial to recognize that external influences play an equally significant role. The relentless demands of modern life, work-related stressors, looming deadlines, and a perpetually connected world all conspire to rob us of the rest we so desperately need.

The term ""pandemic"" is likely a concept you're well-acquainted with. The COVID-19 pandemic serves as a recent and vivid illustration of this phenomenon. When a disease is deemed pandemic, it signifies its widespread occurrence, encompassing regions as vast as continents or even spanning the entire globe. The ebb and flow of pandemics typically follow a pattern, beginning with an initial surge in cases due to person-to-person transmission, often lacking an immediate cure. Subsequently, these outbreaks tend to taper off, and in some cases, the disease may even recede over time. While this general trend holds true for many pandemics, the story of cholera offers a notable exception.

In the dynamic landscape of 2023, achieving millionaire status isn't a daunting endeavor; it's remarkably straightforward, though not necessarily effortless. Let's emphasize simplicity over ease, as the modern era offers an array of opportunities accessible through a smartphone and an internet connection.

The internet is brimming with potential wealth waiting to be harnessed. It's crucial to shift your focus from pointing fingers or waiting for government interventions to taking proactive steps toward financial success. Recognize that while the government plays a role, your aspirations demand your own endeavors. Abundant wealth is within reach for those willing to seize it, so instead of resenting the affluent, seek to learn from them. Surround yourself with individuals who have mastered financial success; their perspectives and strategies can reshape your thinking.

Salt plays a vital role as an essential ingredient in food, serving various purposes beyond mere taste. While some individuals add salt to enhance flavor without fully grasping its significance, others recognize its value in supplying essential minerals such as sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium. Shockingly, the global average salt intake, estimated by the World Health Organization, stands at 10.8 grams per day, which is twice the recommended daily salt intake of less than 5 grams.

Excessive consumption of salt has been linked to detrimental health effects, including increased heart rate, high blood pressure, stroke, kidney disease, and other cardiovascular conditions. Clearly, excessive salt intake is harmful, but what happens when an individual completely eliminates salt from their diet? Let's delve into this topic without delay and gain insight into the experience of a moderately salty diet.

In the midst of health pandemics, we must also address the financial pandemic of widespread financial illiteracy. Many individuals lack knowledge about money and how it flows within our society. So, how can we identify someone who is financially literate?

Identifying a financially literate person is not an impossible task and shouldn't require much time. A five-minute conversation can reveal whether someone possesses financial literacy or not. One key characteristic of financial literacy is having a well-defined financial goal. Goals should be more than just a fleeting desire to be rich; they should be specific, gradual, and accompanied by a clear timeline and numeric targets.

This is the first post after my introduction post, and I decided to check through different communities and I saw leofinance community. This is the first community I will be being a part of and I hope to be part of many other communities. After my first experience with Hive where a person decided to steal my identity to steal from the reward pool, I decided to call for help and I got help from the community. Anyways, I work in the health sector and I love health, but then seeing that the community is finance related, I decided to give it a try. I don't see the niche as a limitation since we are all finance inclined in one way or the other. We all in one way or another have something financial to discuss even when we are not bankers, stockbrokers, financial advisers, or hedge fund traders. You see, our daily life has to do with finance, starting with how we spend money, how we plan our financial life, and how we intend to grow our finance.

Hello everyone, this post is coming very late at midnight according to my time, and that's because I arrived from work very late. This is officially the first post I will be writing on HIVE after a particular user @vynd44 decided to steal my identity to steal rewards meant for honest users. Anyways, I still have to do this post this midnight because I will be having a possible long day at work tomorrow. It is funny how the emergency department is always busy.

My name is Adeyehun Oluwatomisin and I got on Hive about 2 days ago, thanks to @gbenga who brought to my attention a user who was using my identity as well as the content I create on Steemit.com to get rewards on HIVE.BLOG. I am relatively new to the crypto world as well as the blockchain but trust that I have learned a lot, and I am willing to learn more. Before I continue, let me say a big thank you to @guiltyparties and @hivewatchers for helping with resolving the issues, and also thanks for the delegations, they will be ","{""image"":[""https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/thomisin/23xL57DHNoSeqnviiTkA6LCsTjw99YQS96c8dikqaaMZ1nFaFvanXrdUMpcapP5oVAe6f.jpg"",""https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/thomisin/23wgPf3sq4k7BDbhB9VTzRKWGHJjYfFFw74JRmB6SbXUGVomLDXuqgoByfQWPmqSxekrx.jpg"",""https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/thomisin/23xer3rRAeeNRa4fMzbrQ5T1hbMt8MVdQbupxYZiCoqXN8PPw9adRoUAP5S6fgoXU4QTp.jpg"",""https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/thomisin/23xVTPVwX9Lsjvy9yxatTm3BSuGhcSKFPKf3XQbu2dzyqmNKekBLkMpRPPgyHevgdyNme.jpg"",""https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/thomisin/23w2us1fCHsP1visxo4hv2jS1ob6Kzj9Mzp4VV27fmx3uQhioH7KM2dp1o6cme7xJ3hqe.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-174578"",""#introduction"",""#neoxian"",""#nigeria"",""#leofinance"",""#proofofbrain"",""#blog"",""#vyb"",""#hive"",""#introducemyself""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.31-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[0.75,0.4777777777777778,0.75,0.75,0.75]}",2023-03-28 05:06:24,Buzzing into HIVE like the Queen Bee that I am (My Introduction Post),/hive-174578/@thomisin/buzzing-into-hive-like-the,15
