The only thing he offered was terrible memories,
but I felt too weak to fight,
I was betrothed to him before I could differentiate between the male and female gender,
It had become a custom in my hometown,
we were not allowed to make the choice of a life partner,
we had to agree with whomsoever loved us as a child and paid for us to be kept,
Mum had sworn not to allow her children to go through the same experience she had,
she had fought with every power she had,
but her strength had to give way when there was no money to put food on the table,
she had cried out her eyes on the day I was to go to my husband's house,
poverty had silenced her this time around,
Dad had threatened that it was either I got married or he was going to send us all out of the house,

You will agree with me that a smart person makes better decisions and appears to live a more confident and pleasurable life, why would we not desire smartness on all levels if it provides such a good omen. Even if we have been doing things in an unsmart way before, there is always room for improvement and there is always time to make necessary adjustments that could help us become better humans.

Apart from financial needs, most families in my country believe strongly that it is the woman's responsibility to handle household chores and take care of the kids while the men go out to make money.

What could be more interesting than being a stay home Mum who makes lots of money, I am not cut out for the 09:00 am-05:00 pm lifestyle, so if I begin to have kids and I have the opportunity to stay at home and make money while taking care of my kids, I will definitely choose that lifestyle over and over again.

Charles Ponzi is the father of Ponzi schemes, he told investors that they would be able to make 50% of their investment in 45 days and if they could leave their investment for 100 days, they will be making a 100% interest of whatever they invested.

I would like to highlight some of the really important qualities of friendship, this will help us clearly identify when the friendship is indeed a genuine one, we would also be able to differentiate between normal relationships and genuine friendship, this way, they won’t be mistaken one for another.

I was shocked to find my friend (someone I consider a big sister), awake almost all through the night after working her ass off during the day, simply trying to look for opportunities to make extra cash. I had to get up very early to make a great breakfast for her because I know she will stay with her laptop until she dozes off.
It is rather unfortunate that despite her consistent hard work, she does not have much to show for it, when I confronted her about it,  she listed the long list of responsibilities she had to shoulder and I was so scared for her.

With the way time flies very fast, one would wish we could tie a rope around it and make it slow down for our sake, even if it were just for a moment, but if wishes were horses, beggars would ride yeah? Unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing that can be done to tune time and make it slow down, there must however be something/something's we can do to enable us to get time to work well for us, right? I mean, there are humans who achieve so much within the same 24 hours we have in a day, while we sit around and complain about the inadequacy of time for us to achieve all we want to achieve. The question is, how do we beat time and make up for its inadequacy while we achieve as much as we want to achieve on a regular.

For beginners like me, it was a rather scary experience to watch and I had several re-think about my trading decision at that instance. 
While there is a lot of profit to be made while trading appropriately, the loss acquired on trading can affect the trader's mental health, well-being, sanity, and good health. 

As much as I know, trading has a lot of ups and downs, I know that losing excessively can also be curbed/limited. How can traders limit their risk of amassing losses while trading, there are traders who have figured out a way to limit the level of losses involved while trading.

A friend came to spend the weekend at my place because her fiance was travelling for business. While I enjoyed myself during the day and loved that she was around to have our girlie chats and we could unwind together at the poolside, the two nights she spent weren't the best for me. She would wake up to tell me she had a nightmare, and I began to wonder if she was manufacturing these images at every point when she closed her eyes. Writing this, I am laughing as I remember that every moment she closed her eyes, she was going into the dream world, but this time, it was going to be nightmares but in reality, it isn't funny you know. In my post, I will be looking at Nightmares and Sleep (night) terrors.

Today, I want to write about the functionality of the heart and how we can identify quickly when there is a problem with it.

The heart is the major organ of the cardiovascular system, it is a network of blood vessels pumping blood all through the body. The heart is not so big, it is more like the size of a fist, it is comfortably located in the middle of the chest, slightly close to the left. The heart is the muscle at the center of the circulation system, responsible for the pumping of blood around the body while the heart beats, this blood sends nutrients and oxygen to other body parts, and it also moves unwanted carbon dioxide and other waste products away.

It is believed that the more water you take, your body only absorbs a little, and the rest runs down the pipe hole of the urethra. Another myth says that you are likely to urinate more if you drink water while standing to when sitting because the water will quickly get to the bladder.

The Universe is governed by laws and then this laws are properly explained with the help of science. Science have been able to identify a lot of things with humans, diseases, and solve a lot of things but then has science really had answers for everything?

Success is often compared to a game of chance, like winning the lottery. Just because someone achieved success in a particular way doesn't mean that the same formula will work for everyone. However, it's important to acknowledge that there are indeed successful strategies and approaches. Each successful individual has their own unique formula that worked for them, but that doesn't guarantee it will work for others because everyone is different and has their own path to success.

People have varying definitions of success, and it's crucial to respect and honor those individual definitions. Success should be seen as a state where your results align with your expectations. It's not solely about monetary achievements; it's about living your dream and finding fulfillment. Anyone can achieve success at any level as long as their results meet their personal expectations.

While not everyone gets the chance to make such a lucrative investment, some fortunate individuals might strike gold by winning the lottery, inheriting a substantial sum, or experiencing a windfall of wealth. However, this newfound prosperity comes with its own set of challenges, particularly in preserving and growing this wealth to ensure long-term financial security. In this discussion, we will delve into strategies to safeguard your wealth and avoid falling back into financial difficulties after coming into a substantial amount of money.

Let me share a quick tale of two individuals. The first, a hardworking man with a 9-to-5 job, toiled tirelessly to provide for his family. He diligently set aside a portion of his earnings, but it remained stagnant in a savings box, oblivious to the world of investing. The second man, equally hardworking, focused on a single job, trimmed unnecessary expenses, and wisely allocated his surplus funds into the stock market. Interestingly, the first man dubbed the second's approach risky, but as we'll explore, the real risks were quite distinct.

The path of the first man, driven by prudence, might seem secure, yet he unknowingly faced a hidden adversary known as devaluation. His money lost value gradually due to inflation, eroding his purchasing power as the government continued printing money. Meanwhile, the second man's investments not only outpaced inflation but thrived.

There are countless paths to amassing a fortune. The fact that I found my way doesn't imply that yours will be the same. Many individuals have achieved financial success through diverse avenues, and in this discussion, I draw insights from various research and studies conducted on these successful individuals.

At its core, making money revolves around one crucial principle: being indispensable. Merely emulating what others have done won't propel you far. To truly flourish, you must become indispensable to those who rely on your services. Your value should transcend conventional job titles. Infuse artistry, humanity, and meaningful connections into your pursuits, ensuring that you are indispensable because your role cannot be neatly defined. Injecting passion, energy, initiative, and problem-solving prowess into your work sets you on the path to indispensability, whether in business or employment.

It's undeniable that the allure of wealth has captivated many, leading to the proliferation of countless get-rich-quick schemes that prey on these aspirations. While the desire for financial prosperity is widespread, a significant number of individuals seem to harbor a ""lottery lifestyle"" mentality, anticipating a sudden windfall or moment of sheer luck to transform their circumstances.

This notion, however, often rests on a fallacy. The misconception that acquiring a substantial sum of money will instantly alleviate all problems is far from reality. In truth, without the guidance of sound investments and a well-defined strategy, even a windfall of a billion dollars could evaporate within a shockingly short span, leaving individuals right back where they started.

Greetings, everyone! Today, I want to explore a scenario where I've lost everything I had and find myself starting from scratch. How can I regain financial security and freedom? Let's dive into a plan for rebuilding.

To begin, I'd embrace the practice of turning trash into treasure. Many items that people discard still hold value. By scavenging and repurposing these items, I can create a revenue stream. Selling them on various online marketplaces can generate income. Remember, there are hidden gems waiting to be discovered even in what seems like junk.

Retirement; a concept that invokes visions of leisure and freedom, and for some, a dream to be realized as early as 40 years of age. While some individuals, like myself, are driven by the thrill of problem-solving and do not aspire to retire, many desire to achieve financial independence at a relatively young age. If you find yourself in the latter category, this post is tailored to guide you on your journey.

The first hurdle to overcome is the numbers game. How much do you need to retire? This question elicits varying answers, as it depends on individual preferences and aspirations. Some seek a modest nest egg, while others envision a more comfortable and worry-free retirement. To navigate this seemingly elusive goal, consider the rule of 300. By following this simple rule, you can plan for retirement more effectively. For instance, if your monthly expenses amount to $1000, then you should aim to save $300,000 to secure your retirement.

At some point in life, many of us experience a windfall of money, commonly known as hitting the jackpot. It may not always be winning the lottery, but there are moments when it seems like we possess the Midas touch, and money flows abundantly. Whether you become a millionaire or not, these moments offer a chance to secure your financial future if managed wisely. In this post, I'll share essential tips for handling sudden wealth, be it from a new job, a lucrative contract, or a steady revenue stream.

The first thing to do is to have an investment budget. Investment should be a priority and not an afterthought. It should be regarded as the main thing to do first when you have money, instead of the last thought after taking care of every other thing. You can either win with money, worry about money, or waste money, whichever you pick, it is your choice and you would stand by it.

In our ever-changing world, the divide between the successful and struggling individuals has always intrigued me. After observing various lives, I have come to deduce the following key insights:

People who are poor actually have a lifestyle inflation problem. It is no news that for a lot of people, spending increases directly with income, either arithmetically, or exponentially. The sooner a lot of people start to earn more, they start to spend more, and this thing happens subconsciously. When a person gets an increment at work, they begin by getting a new wardrobe, a new car, a new house, and so on. This spending starts innocently but over time, the brain is triggered to see those new changes in luxury as necessities. This actually leads to more money, to keep up with the lifestyle which isn't even real because at any point in time, there is a financial hiccup, you will be close to ground zero.

However, while becoming rich is undoubtedly challenging, staying rich can be even more difficult. Just take a look at the financial lives of numerous athletes who were once millionaires at the peak of their careers, only to end up in debt or completely broke.

We might wonder, ""What money mistakes did these individuals make that led them from extreme wealth to having just a few dollars in their accounts or being burdened by debt?"" Let's explore these mistakes and see if we can learn from them.

One common mistake I've observed is when people become full of themselves after attaining wealth. When someone is rich, they can throw money at problems, and those problems tend to disappear. This newfound sense of invincibility often leads them to make careless mistakes.

Another pitfall is losing track of spending.

My neighbor parked his car for the past 2 months because the car is faulty. I thought he was going to repair the car a day after he parked it but it is two months and still counting but he is yet to repair the car. The car is still fairly new as he hasn't driven it for more than a year. Currently, he takes a shuttle to work and back. Yesterday, I saw him looking at his car and shaking his head like he had made a mistake buying the car. This got me to ask myself if he didn't know the actual cost of a car.

When we want to purchase a car, we often look at the amount we want to pay for the car either in installments or at once, but we do not tend to understand that the cost of a car goes beyond the amount paid when buying it. A lot of people buy cars on debt and I wonder why someone will do that unless they intend to use the car for business and have done proper research on how much would be made with the car.

I woke up a few days ago looking through my goals and plans for the year, how far I still have to cover, and how I felt I have been unable to achieve anything, I felt as though a hole was created in my heart and I was moved to tears, I instantly called my sister who spoke words to m that made me feel better, she is the only one we all speak to whenever we need someone to talk to and sometimes, I wonder who she has to call because she just acts so strong. 

Life can be tough on us sometimes, but we consistently need to look for ways to come out of whatever depressing feeling we may have, steps should be taken to cope and navigate through depression, and the little changes that are made to a daily routine, lifestyle habits, and diets could go a long way to positively affect you. Depression can drain out all your energy, leaving you feeling fatigued and empty, but lifestyle changes here and there could turn you into a happy soul again.

There is a company known for ''debt relief'' or ''debt adjusting'', the purpose of this company is to provide general offers to help with the contact of creditors on the debtor's behalf, the essence of this company is to provide a path of negotiation or a better payment plan to help reduce or settle the debt. Their typical charge rate is usually a percentage of the amount you would save on the settled debt.

I have been away from the hive blockchain for some days now and that is because of my preparation for my examination another reason is a result of the fresh hardship instilled on Nigerians through the removal of subsidies without any plans in place to get things bearable for citizens, it's been so hectic the past few days, some of us who are unable to afford the increased transport fare will have to move around on foot covering possible regions to a reasonable extent, so when I get back home, all that my body is craving for, is a good time of rest and food. With the high spike in fuel, it is only certain that the price of commodities will increase as well, which means the days ahead may even be tougher for thousands of Nigerians who are already living in hunger and abject poverty.

Permit me to share my friend's story, she was once in a relationship with a young man from a humble background, he literally had nothing when she meet him, but he was hard working and she believed so much in him, they went through the rough days together and all that, most of our friends always advised her to move on with the financially stable young men that were coming for her at the time, but she insisted that she has a strong feeling for this man and she wouldn't play with it for any reason.

the way, time flies consistently, and the only way we can meet up is by waking up every day to put in the required effort to make things work, if that is not done, we will realize soon how much time could fly and how we have gotten stuck at the point where we have not been able to achieve anything at all. Why do you think some people are able to achieve a great deal of success while others in a similar field only work hard but are unable to achieve just a little? It all boils down to being consistent.

Consistency means being able to fully dedicate yourself to goals or tasks, it means being able to focus on your goal without any type of distraction. Commitment means that you basically commit yourself to a sustained effort of deliberate action over a long term, with this, you keep your watchword to yourself and follow through consistently on what needs to be done over a long time until you get to that point of goal achievement.

Things are getting a little better these days, but professions like being a doctor, a lawyer, and the like, are things that parents are proud of but any other thing that appears casual is not what they want for their child.

Before we can talk about success either financially or in our endeavors, we need to first talk about an end goal, a dream, and a vision. It will be wrong to set out on a journey without a destination or without having a purpose for the journey. You can imagine buying a ticket for a destination you do not have an idea of its name, or when you are asked, you answer by saying you are not sure of your destination. That is an example of what I am talking about. It is very wrong to decide to start a financial journey without knowing your endpoint.

Hello friends, welcome back to my blog you know we started this journey of financial growth, and today, I will like to talk about retirement. While we save for investment, and while we go through daily struggles, we have to also remember the place for retirement savings. There comes a time in our lives when we would no longer be able to go through the daily hustle and tussle, as smart minds we must always bear that in mind and ensure our actions fits appropriately to save our future. Putting money away for retirement is a good habit we can all develop and live with.

In Nigeria, bank staff is mandated to open a specific number of bank accounts on a monthly basis, in order to meet that target, they would plead with people to open accounts, even some of us who have no money to put in it, thankfully, there is a type of account for the student, where you can open without a penny.  That explains why I have lots of bank accounts my friends. The case is however different for wealthy people, they usually open different bank accounts for different reasons, either to boost the work level of a bank staff they are trying to support or for some advantage that the bank will be able to offer compared to other banks.

Some scientists refer to aging as a disease. It is regarded as the mother of all diseases as it allows the immune system to become weaker and people are able to fall sick easily. The world health organization also sees this light and agrees that aging is a result of molecular and cellular damage that leads to other health conditions.

From Arnold Berthold in 1849 that worked on Capons, and discovered the effect of testis in birds, to Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard and Thomas Addison who worked on the elixir which was a combination of blood from the testicular veins, semen, and juice extracted from the testicles which were crushed immediately after it was extracted from a guinea pig or a dog. This was known as the Brown-Séquard elixir which was believed to have rejuvenated him but was not reproducible with other scientific tests but led to the experiment on hormones. I discussed Victor Horsley, and George Oliver in my previous post, and they were frontrunners in the discovery of hormones. let's continue without wasting any time.

There is a group of different biochemicals that flow through our body as humans, determining a lot of things. It is responsible for a lot of our actions and ability, and while so many people do not give credit to its function the way they do to the brain and the heart, on a daily basis there are ground-opening discoveries on what these chemicals can do in the human body. The chemicals are known as Hormones. I will be doing a little bit of endocrinology and a little of just general science in this post, moreover, hormones are the cutting edge of medical science.

Whether we agree or not, hormones control almost everything in our bodies. Unlike the vascular system, the skeletal system, or the cardiovascular organs, hormones aren't things we see with our regular eyes. While they are invisible to the regular eyes, they are responsible for regulating our bodies.

Forgiveness is a basic necessity for life, we know that being able to forgive people gives us peace of mind and unending happiness but there are people who also take the act of easy forgiveness as a weakness to hurt those with a good heart even more regularly, that is a reason why it is necessary for us to learn to forgive but not give people a chance to constantly hurt us at will again.
That takes me down to writing about not forgetting the wrongs people do to us, people say this but really how right or how justifiable do you think it is, let's get into exploring the topic.

It is a rare heart condition whose cause is unknown that causes the inflammation of medium-sized blood vessels. It was previously known as **mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome**, it is associated with fever and it affects children under the age of 5 years but can affect any age. It was first reported in 1961 by Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki in Japan. The first case of Kawasaki disease was a four-year-old male patient which was presented with a high fever for about 2 weeks. The child demonstrated symptoms such as bilateral conjunctival hyperemia, bleeding lips, mucus membrane, strawberry-looking tongue, diffuse erythema of the oral cavity, and dried and reddish lips. In 5 years, Dr. Kawasaki observed 50 cases that had similar presentations.

If you are familiar with the word Typhoid and malaria, I do not mean in books, I mean in person or reality, then you are from an underdeveloped country, possibly a country in Africa.

Today, I am discussing the prefix and not the suffix, so we will be discussing Typhoid fever. Even in the best part of Lagos, in Nigeria, people still have to buy water from another part of the state because the water is terrible. Lagosians living in the Lekki region of Lagos can relate to this.

If you haven't read the post, I will be putting the link at the end of this post. You should find time to read it, it is a post worthy of reading. Today, I will be writing on African Trypanosomiasis also known as sleeping sickness which is a protozoan disease. While I was in the boarding house in junior school, there was a fellow student who was always sleeping. He would sleep at every opportunity and most time my teacher would compare him to a Koala bear, or would ask him if he had been beaten by the Tsetse fly.To be candid my school was close to a forest and we always had Tsetse fly visiting, in fact we killed them as a game along with Black fly but trust me when I say the guys sleeping wasn't as a result of Tsetse fly, it could be a disorder or maybe just genetics. Anyways, our teacher always thought he was beating by Tsetse fly.

The Teeth are bony structures in the mouth used for chewing and grinding food. It is important in speech and vocalization. The teeth are very hard, and that is why it is referred to as a bony structure. According to the Mohs Hardness scale, Tooth Enamel is harder than steel. The outer part of the tooth is known as the enamel. It is made up of hydroxyapatite, a type of calcium that gives it its durability and strength.

One of the most important activity we must participate in to live is to breath. Sometimes, I ask myself which really determines true death not clinical death; is it when you stop breathing, when the brain stops working or when your heart stops beating. Actually, you can hold your breath and still be alive, but when you are unable to take breath in, then you are obviously not living anymore. Clinical death is when the brain stops working and dies, but I am not doing that now, I am looking into breathing and the lungs. While we breath normally, but during exercise, the pulmonary respiration can go up to 20 fold and we know that with exercise, two organs play important roles and they are the heart and the lungs. I will be looking at the lungs and its function or morphology during exercise.

Hello friends, hope you are having a great time as we gradually approach the festive season?In the spirit of consistent learning, I will like to explore the topic ''Myoclonic Seizure''.

Myoclonic seizure occurs when the muscle suddenly contracts, creating fast twitching movements, affecting one side of the body, most often the neck, shoulders as well as upper arms, the entire body could also get affected. The entire length of the seizure could be really short that is is mistaken for; tics, nervousness and clumsiness. Myoclonic seizure is a certain type of myoclonus that happens as a result of an underlying epileptic condition of the brain. Epilepsy is a disease where abnormal electrical signals in the brain creates impairment in your ability to function normally. 

The fact that we mentioned that myoclonic seizure happens as a result of an underlying condition does not means that is the only reason why it can happen, certain cases of myoclonus can happen in cases that are not li","{""links"":[""https://nortonchildrens.com/news/can-seizures-cause-brain-damage/"",""https://www.tessresearch.org/living-with-slc13a5-epilepsy/manage-seizures/"",""https://www.healthline.com/health/epilepsy/myoclonic-seizure#summary"",""https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23172-myoclonic-seizure"",""https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy/seizure-types/myoclonic-seizures"",""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/epilepsy/myoclonic-seizures"",""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20365711"",""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/myoclonic-seizure"",""https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/brain,-spinal-cord,-and-nerve-disorders/seizure-disorders/seizure-disorders"",""https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003200.htm""],""image"":[""https://nortonchildrens.com/wp-content/uploads/Can-seizures-cause-brain-damage-c.jpg"",""https://www.tessresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Patients_Manage-Seizures-scaled.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""health"",""seizure"",""neoxian"",""oc",2022-12-19 01:10:00,Myoclonic Seizure- A Sudden Muscle Contraction.,/hive-196387/@bimbo45/myoclonic-seizure-a-sudden-muscle,3

The autonomic nervous system is a sub-division of the nervous system. That being said, let me explain the nervous system. The **nervous system** is a combination of neurons and non-neuron cells known as glia. Different neurons are responsible for performing different activities in the body. The sensory neuron is responsible for sending smell, light, taste, temperature, pressure, and messages to the brain, Motor neurons are responsible for sending movement messages to the brain. The nervous system can be divided into the Central Nervous system and the Peripheral nervous system.

She would tell me that when I get goosenbumps, there were ghosts around where I was.

In this post, I will be sharing with you, what causes goosebumps which is completely different from what my grandmother told me.

When you skin raises up, bringing protrusions is what is refered to as Goosebumps. Some call it goose pimples, goose flesh, and other call it goose bumples but it has the word goose, and I could say that it got its name from its look which resembles the skin of a featherless goose. This could be the reason behind the name Goosebumps. Goosebumps occur in the skin, and the skin is made up of three layers, which are the Epidermis, the Dermis, and the Hypodermis.

Cough is one of the most underrated medical issues experienced in my country, (I cannot be certain about other countries), over here, most cases of cough are treated with over-the-counter medications which are relatively affordable and easy to purchase. 
While we may want to avoid cough for the rest of our lives because of the great level of inconvenience that it brings, it would be good to know that, cough also has its own benefits. When we cough, foreign materials, and mucus are brought out of the airways, and these materials would usually irritate the lungs. Most cases of cough would last for just a few days or a few weeks.

Things are getting as hard as they can economically, I would have said in the part of the world where I come from, but it is definitely not my country alone that is getting affected. I initially used to think the economic condition was limited to some certain region, maybe the region where I am living, but I have seen more people complain about financial hardship during this period and that has made me come to the conclusion that there are more people going through financial difficulty at the time.

As for me, I have been reading and learning about finance, and the more you learn, the more,  you want to know. At this time, it is very important to cut down certain house expenses, as well as personal spending habits, alongside improving our earnings would do so much magic.

He was able to save his girlfriend and they both taught all was well until suddenly, he slumped one day while taking a walk on the street, he was rushed to the hospital and doctors confirmed that the other kidney he had left was infected. This is a serious case that needs urgent appropriate treatment. The question to be answered is;
* What is a kidney infection.
* How it can be identified.

Some time ago, I wrote about a sister I admire so much in this community, she has a great personality and good business skills, I wrote about her business and how she was holding up with her business despite the bad economy. She made a decision not to give up, most importantly I remember telling her about letting her staff go but she choose to pay her staff from the extra money made from external jobs, her intention was to keep putting food on the table for her staff during these hard times.
However, last week she called me to tell me about her plans to close down the business after the holidays, I wondered why she was making this choice, and here are the reasons she gave me.

Skin colour is one subject that people have argued a little bit about. Some say it arises from genetics, others say it could be due to location and the nearness to the sun. While some are dark-skinned, some are white, some are red, and we have other people with different colour of skins. If location is a factor, then I see so many whites who come as expatriates to my country and give birth here, and their children do not change skin colour due to a change in geographical location. I remember a time someone was saying that people who are light skin do not have melanin in their skin. That is one thing I cannot say for now, but as you go on with this post, you would know if white people have melanin or not. I will be looking at skin colour, what you should know about, and how the colour of our skin is determined

Medications are supposed to help alleviate symptoms of illness, when we get sick, it is usual for doctors to recommend appropriate medications that will make the illness disappear, however not all medications are safe for consumption for every body type. Hence, the need to avoid self-medication as much as possible, it is advisable to visit a medical expert any time we feel ill, as a proper check-up will help them identify the type of drugs that our body can function well with.

There are times when even medical experts will recommend certain medications to us without the consciousness of how they can affect us, the moment we begin to feel strange reactions after the intake of a new drug or after we increase the dosage of a certain medication, it is advisable to visit a medical expert instantly. One of the side effects that medication intake can cause to the body is, **Serotonin Syndrome**.

In 2021, David showed a video of an Edema in his leg and that he had undergone surgery. The post today isn't about David, but about Edema. David was showing a swelling in his legs, and that explains in a shallow form what edema is.

Hello everyone, welcome to my today's post. In this post, I will writing on Peripheral Vascular Disease. It is important to know that Peripheral Vascular disease is a circulatory disorder that progresses to narrow and block blood vessels that are not in the heart and the brain. It is the obstruction of blood flow due to vessel damage within the peripheral vascular system. It is important to know that the Peripheral Vascular system is responsible for providing blood to arms, hand, feet, and legs, with the exception of the chest and abdomen, and off course, the except the heart and the brain. The Peripheral vascular system includes arteries, veins. When there are peripheral vascular diseases, it can affect the arteries (Peripheral Arterial Disease), and it can affect the veins (Peripheral Venous Disease), and it usually affects the lower extremities.

It is important to quickly state the function of the arteries and the veins. The arteries take oxygenated blood away from the heart ","{""links"":[""https://commons.wikimedia"",""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/overview-of-the-vascular-system"",""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/peripheral-arterial-disease-pad/"",""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/peripheral-vascular-disease"",""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/atherosclerosis"",""https://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookId=2129&sectionId=192030522"",""https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/condition/atherosclerosis"",""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis"",""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis/symptoms"",""https://www.healthline.com/health/peripheral-vascular-disease#complications""],""image"":[""https://images.ecency.com/DQmYvdJTdczJ2DMaiGdPrHTXF29yqMRqhPZk9MoC4u4GL1q/image.png"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blausen_Peripheral_Arterial_Disease_eng.svg""],""thumbnails"":[""https://images.ecency.com/DQmYvdJTdczJ2DMaiGdPrHTXF29yqMRqhPZk9MoC4u4GL1q/image.png"",""https://commons.wikime",2022-10-31 12:30:36,"Peripheral Vascular Disease, Causes, Signs and Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment",/hive-196387/@bimbo45/peripheral-vascular-disease-causes-signs,7

We are always careful to do things appropriately at work because we do not want to receive any form of query from our boss, especially when we fall under the accounting department, but while we are so good at ensuring that our boss money is appropriately managed, we seem to care less about our own spending habit.

From the day I was told she was pregnant, till the day she put to bed, she didn't have a protruding stomach, so it would be difficult to assume she was pregnant, but she added a lot of weight. One thing I noticed was that she was continuously using the restroom to ease her bladder. For clarity, even though I wasn't told early enough that my aunt was pregnant, I noticed she had been easing her bladder from the early stage of her pregnancy. In this post, I will look into why women ease their bladder more when they are pregnant compared to when they aren't pregnant.

Hello everyone, it is good to have you here on my blog post today. Today, I will be writing about a bilirubin condition known as jaundice. I remember some years ago, my aunt spent nights at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), because my baby cousin had jaundice. She was very worried and at a point, I stopped worrying about the child but for her. At the end, the child received a blood transfusion, and other treatment, and over time, we were back home.

I was reminded of this painful reality today when I was speaking with a close male friend who was pouring out his heart to me. He actually got a job after he barged his BSC, and as expected from a normal African home, he took the burden off his parents who were almost retired at the time, he helped with his siblings school fees amongst meeting other household needs. However, two years down the line, he began to have issues at work, he eventually lost the job and of course had nothing to fall back on, since all he made was spent on his family.

We cannot all deny the fact that vitamins are essential nutrients required for body functionality. There are different types of vitamins, ranging from;

* Fat-soluble vitamins, which include Vitamins A, D, E, and K.
* Water-soluble vitamins, which include Vitamins B and C.
These vitamins have their functions and each of them is subdivided into different categories. However, in this post, I want to concentrate more on vitamin C and the impact it adds on the body.

Vitamin C is a very important micronutrient needed by humans. It contributes greatly to immune deficiency through the support it renders to different cellular functions of both the innate and adaptive immune systems.

As a child in the primary school, I was taught that when I have injuries in my arm while playing, my blood will cover it for me. My teacher didn't explain the process to me, but she gave me an idea that my blood was doing more than just circulating round my body. In my junior secondary education, my teacher made it clear that the blood platelet was responsible for blood clotting when I have an injury or break in my skin. So, I am no more in primary school or secondary school. In fact, a friend and I have worked on analyzing blood, and now, I know better about blood and blood clotting.

I need to say clearly that contrary to what my elementary teachers told me about blood clotting being a good thing, we need to know that blood clotting has both the good and the bad side, so I will be doing justice to that today.

Remember that, the fact that you hold grudges towards someone does not mean, they wouldn’t do well, having to constantly watch someone who you are hurt by succeeding, would create some form of hole in your heart. Regardless of how clean your heart is, living with a a deep grudge in your heart would begin to build some type of hatred towards your fellow human and in the long run, deprive you of your own sanity.

While there may be some sort of similarities between smallpox and chicken pox because of the features of blisters and rashes common with them and because of the pox in their names, they should never be confused for each other because they are completely different diseases.

Lead! Lead!! Lead!!! You must have heard about the word Lead poisoning or put in another word, lead toxicity, and you might be thinking what is this? Well, A friend told me that in Zamfara state, Northern Nigeria, people suffer from lead poisoning. It doesn't matter how it gets into the body, either it is absorbed, swallowed or breathed-in, it will have the same health effects.

Lead is an environmental heavy metal, which is poisonous and causes  serious and damaging health problems. Lead toxicity is a condition where there is an increased lead concentration in the blood. Children are majorly affected with lead poisoning. According to a [research](https://www.amjmed.com/article/0002-9343(72)90015-0/fulltext), the incident of lead poisoning was uncovered in over 4000 children, and more males are affected than females in adults. Lead can get into the body via inhalation of the lead particle or injestion of the lead contaminated water,  or food.

The level of comparison we base our lives on is the reason why we feel down most of the times, looking back at our previous achievements and comparing them with our new standards is the best way to motivate ourselves in my own opinion.

Through this post, I want to share few helpful tips on how we can become our own biggest motivation, it is my hope that after reading this, we will have more reasons to motivate ourselves further and really more on our own motivation.

A few days ago, a friend of mine called me that he was going to get a tattoo on his arm. He actually spent over 200 thousand Naira to get the tattoo done. I haven't seen him since then, only for him to show up in my house in pains, and also furious. He had just been to two places, the police station and the hospital. I was fascinated by the event, and decided to ask what led him to go to the two place. It turned out that he just arrested the manager of the tattoo parlor where he had his tattoo, and he was at the hospital because the tattoo he just had, was infected, and his skin was looking rot with swelling. He said he was diagnosed with hyperkeratosis.

Burying a person long after death isn't something people aren't familiar with, since there are ways to prevent the body from swelling and delay or prevent decomposition of the body in the mortuary, but according to my friend, his father's wish was to be buried without any form of embalming. So the cadaver had to stay for 2 days and few hours before being buried. The man died on a Monday, and it took his children the following day to arrive at their family residence. I also arrived the following day with my friend to pay my condolences, I never knew I was going to be attending a Christian wake-keep as well.

What made her feel really pained was the fact that she never got the chance to reconcile with him before he passed on, she was beyond heartbroken at that time and she was making promises never to keep grudges with anyone ever again. I felt so bad too and this made me forgive someone whose behavior really hurt me, I questioned myself on how I will really feel if something happened to this person I genuinely care about.

When a couple is married for years, and children aren't forthcoming, then the parents start to mount pressure on the couple to give them a grandchild. In all this, women are at the receiving end, giving them a reason to worry when they aren't pregnant yet.

I was talking to a lady yesterday, and all of a sudden, she started to groan in pains, squeezing her abdomen. She became uncomfortable all of a sudden, and even a blind person could tell that she was in pains. I was forced to ask what was wrong, and she said she felt this pain in her abdomen, and it started since she became inconsistent in her eating routine. She has been going for a long period of time without eating for a while now, and she has been feeling this pain once in a while after a long period of feeling hungry. Does prolonged periods without food tend to lead to Peptic Ulcer? What is Peptic Ulcer? In this post, I will do my best to explain what you need to know about Peptic Ulcer.

Happiness is a strong path to long life obviously,  making a decision to be happy means you are making the decision to keep your sanity. It is more than necessary to look out for the things that make you happy and stick with the path of happiness constantly.  I want to share some of the strategies that will help boost/maintain happiness for us in this post.

* Surround yourself with people who make you happy. 
You come in contact with some set of people and every minute of the time you spend with them, will keep you smiling all through the day, it is very wise to stay very close to people like that because your happiness will be enhanced, instead of staying close to people who constantly and regularly have something to complain about and are always sad. If you do not have the capacity to cut ties completely with the people who are regularly bitter, then just reduce your activities with them.

Consistency is a serious attribute for success, the act of consistency means you are dedicating yourself to the set goals required for the attainment of success. Consistency is an act that runs for a long-term basis, it requires a consistent and regular long-term commitment and involves a regular sustained effort to get things done adequately.

Success in life is achieved through consistency and effort put into productive activities. Certainly, miracles happen, but the certainty of success is closely related to the hard work and consistency we put into activities.

I will start this post by telling you a very (loud) secret about the childbirth policy in Africa, in Africa, as a woman, you have to get pregnant naturally, a woman who does not carry her own child through the process of pregnancy is regarded as being barren. This evil and old mindset has put a lot of women through depression and untimely death, as they crave, pray and live every day for the moment they will get pregnant and carry their own child. The bad aspect of this tradition lies in the fact that some men are the ones with medical issues and as a result, have childbirth difficulty, but a typical African mother-in-law would go ahead to frustrate the woman with the claims of not being able to give her a grandchild.

Thankfully, we are more exposed now, things are getting better for the African woman, the African woman can now choose what she wants to do with her body and the african woman is now very aware of the available options for her to have a child either she has carried ","{""app"":""peakd/2022.07.1"",""format"":""markdown"",""tags"":[""stem"",""neoxian"",""pregnancy"",""biology"",""gem"",""ocd"",""steemng"",""steemgeek"",""hive-196387""],""users"":[""bimbo45""],""image"":[""https://images.pexels.com/photos/3094435/pexels-photo-3094435.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1600""]}",2022-08-26 19:46:57,"The process of IVF,  a great substitute for natural pregnancy.",/hive-196387/@bimbo45/the-process-of-ivf-a-great-substitute-for-natural-pregnancy,4

From the beginning of civilization, humans have always wanted to look good. You can imagine talking with a person who hasn't had their bath, brushed their teeth, or groomed their hair for a long time. I see that look. That's how it is. Looking good has been part of our daily activity and in other to do that, simple things like washing our body is important. It is no doubt that washing our body prevents a lot of disease and infection in our body. Center for Disease Control and Prevention ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/personal-hygiene/index.html)) confirms that personal hygiene can help prevent and control hygiene related diseases. The personal hygiene includes washing parts of our body with soap and water, cutting our nails, washing our hands regularly and so on. While the hygiene aspect is no doubt important, the looking good aspect seems to be the pressing matter in the heart of humans (like my friend will say, ""never to be caught un-fresh"").

You know, it is so funny how some ladies believe that the hormone estrogen isn't present in young children. The mindset that estrogen is the hormone responsible for the enhancement and growth of females and their reproductive features, but not present in them as children is wrong. Children have Estradiol hormone, which is a member of the estrogen hormone in their body, but it isn't available in large quantities, making its effect not visible. [1]. Estrogen is one of the two sex hormones in females, with the other being progesterone. Estrogen is a combination of three hormones (Estriol, Estrone, and Estradiol). [2]. In this post, I will be explaining the Hormone Estrogen.

Let us do a few facts check before we begin with this post. Do you know that the human body has about 34 trillion cells which functions for years just to keep us alive? [1]. These cells include blood cells, nerve cells, stem cell, Bone cells, skin cells, muscle cells, endothelial cells, Fat cells, and egg cells.  Some of these cells are transported via Arteries, veins, and capillary.  The human arteries, veins, and capillaries, when measured, is over 60,000 miles long (just long enough to round the world twice). [2]. The heart is not one big organ, in fact, it isn't bigger than a fist, (10 ounces in men, and 8 ounces in women), but it is the most important organ of the body. All other organs, tissues, and cells are important, but they all depend on the heart to function. The heart beats about 100,000 times in a day, pumping 2000 gallons of blood through the veins, arteries and capillaries, to other part of the body daily [3].

It has to do with the mentality that no one is supposed to get depressed in the first place.

The joy of motherhood is something that cannot be covered by a woman who just put to bed, seeing her child in her hands. You see, there is this unseen energy that you get when you see that innocent soul sleeping peacefully. You start to recollect every moment of the pregnancy, from the first trimester, Antenatal/ Antepartum hospital visits, maternity gymnastics, down to shopping and preparing the cradle a few weeks before the child came, and everything just looks beautiful. While the process of conception, and the stages of pregnancy is a fantastic journey to explain, I will be taken you on the journey of Labor.

I was talking to a 1st year dietician yesterday, and while we were having the conversation, we slightly mentioned the abdominal organs but to my surprise, she said the abdomen only had the stomach as its organ. The discussion took place because a young man asked someone to give him a punch in his abdomen. I do not know why but he said, that he could resist pains when he stiffens the abdominal muscles. I told the lady that he was actually putting the home of his major organs at risk and she said, it was only the stomach that was at risk. Well, I can't judge her for being wrong, knowledge is acquired, and what you do not know is often way ahead of you waiting to chase and get it. A lot of us, sincerely, cannot identify where the organs in our body are located, their functions, and general morphology. We are going to look into the organs and their arrangement in the body. Today, we will be looking at the Abdominal anatomy.

Once done in the bathroom, I leave and go to the gym where I ensure that I am hydrated enough during my exercise routine, Then I go back home for another bath. I prepare breakfast, and in the process, I  make sure I wash everything I will use and cook properly. Let's leave my daily routine for now and let's face the concern that led to this post.

While business experts may find this as a norm and have a way around it, it may come on all too sudden for a small business owner who is only trying to grow. 

In this post, I want to share with you some of the steps that can be taken to help a business owner stay afloat even when things are down in business.
The first thing we should know is that, at a time like this one, the focus may have to be shifted a little bit from making a profit to completely surviving. Do not be quick to make rational decisions like closing down, the business because it is simply a phase that would pass definitely.

This made me realize the need to create time to study/oversee a business especially when it is a small one, it is usually difficult to control it from a distance. Understandably, there are periods when we need to get a helping hand to assist us in running the affairs of the business, but even while we employ someone to assist, it is our own duty to ensure that we properly monitor every activity going on around it.

Manipulative people are control freaks who will do anything to satisfy their own selfish desires, since you do not want to live your life to please anyone or under the control of anyone's authority, it is extremely necessary for you to take a step back, identify the presence of every manipulative person around you and refrain from further engagements in a relationship like that.

The difference between the wealthy and the poor begins with the type of mindset we carry around, then the decisions that we make and how we turn gathered information into a reasonable effort.

You will agree with me that a smart person makes better decisions and appears to live a more confident and pleasurable life, why would we not desire smartness on all levels if it provides such a good omen.
