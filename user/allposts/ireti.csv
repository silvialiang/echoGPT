Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that affects the pancreas. The Pancrease is a gland located behind the stomach that plays a role in digesting food and regulating blood sugar in the body. Pancreatic cancer is often diagnose late, and has a poor prognosis. The mvast majority of pancreatic cancer is known as adenocarcinoma, which  occurs in the head of the pancrease. which are the cells that produce the enzymes needed for digestion, and then begin to compress the bile duct causing Obstructive jaundice (symptoms similar to pancreatic cancer).

In the post, I will be referring to it as Mastication, which is the medical word for the process of grinding food with our teeth and the entire process of chewing. Let me ask this very fast ""Do you chew properly when eating, or do you just swallow as fast as you can?""

Hello everyone, welcome to this post today. In my post, I will be writing about the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland that is located in the neck which is in proximity to the trachea, and inferior to the Larynx. It produces hormones that regulate the body's metabolism and energy levels in a way that when it is produced less, the body's energy and metabolism are reduced, and when it is at an increased rate, the rate of metabolism can increase above 60% above the normal level.

The thyroid gland, located inferior to the larynx and in proximity to the trachea is made up primarily of follicular cells which produce and secrete the thyroid hormone. In the brain, the hypothalamus which performs lots of functions including maintaining homeostasis sends signals to the pituitary gland which sends signals to the thyroid gland to secrete the thyroid hormone.

I went to my village to visit my grandmother, and I realized that the only packaged thing she knew or was familiar with is Biscuits, and she claimed that she didn't eat them. Trust me when I say that I believed her because she doesn't have any reason to lie to me. She talked about eating everything fresh, and lest I forget, she is a centenarian and she looks very young compared to some people who are at their age of 50 years. Everything she used to prepare fish stew was fresh from the ground, and in fact, she harvested the Onions she used herself. I cannot remember when last I ate something truly fresh. Living in an industrial area, we are used to seeing foods and food items in bags, bottles, nylons, packs, tins, and cartons. I then thought had to do a little study on how this food remained fresh, or how it maintained its taste, colour, and or odour.

Vegetable acid poisons are present in fruits and vegetables such as almonds, peach, apple, and different vegetables.

Cancer occurs when normal cells become overgrown or multiply beyond control as a result of responding differently to cell growth regulatory signals. The number of cells in the body is maintained by the number of cell division which gives rise to more cells and cell death. When there are uncontrollable cell division and lower or no death of the cells, they can lead to abnormal cell growth which can become malignant or benign tumors. Cancers are malignant tumors that starts by damaging the DNA of the cell where they are affecting in the form of mutation. Cancer is malignant that occurs as a result of mitosis where there is an uncontrollable division but can be treated through numerous ways which include surgical, chemotherapy, Biological (self-body treatment), and radiotherapy. When we deal with the pharmacology of cancer then Chemotherapy is what we are talking about.

As children, our parents got us immunized by taking us to the hospital for the necessary injections. I remembered in primary school, some government bodies came to immunize us from polio, and to date, a lot of people are immunized on a daily basis against diseases. So what do we understand by Immunization? 

The inducing of immunity against a specific disease either passively through the administration of antibody-containing preparations or actively by administering steroids or vaccines. This treatment is aimed at preventing diseases and providing possible lasting resistance to infections. As important as vaccination, a lot of children have not been immunized, and the number of children that aren't immunized continues to decrease regularly., According to the [CDC (2022)](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/immunization/), 25 million children missed out on important vaccines in 2021, and this was 2 million higher than the year 2019.

While the pathophysiology is not clearly understood, one important factor for Rosacea is genetics. Some other factors such as foods and beverages. It can be due to the dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune functioning, as well as vasodilation and dilation of lymphatic vessels.

As youths, a lot of people get involved in a lot of musculoskeletal activities, all in the name of keeping fit, or while working to get their daily bread, and this could lead to musculoskeletal pain. When people present themselves to a clinician as having pain, the question then becomes if it is benign musculoskeletal pain or a warning sign for an underlying serious condition.

If we have to break down the definition according to its name, then musculoskeletal pain would be pain that affects the muscle or the skeleton. These can be pain in the joint, trauma injuries, occupational repetitive motion pain, and other types of pain such as osteoarthritis pain. Pains can also be neuropathic pain which is pain caused by lesions or diseases that affect the somatosensory nervous system. It is an unpleasant experience associated with tissue damage or potential tissue damage.

The body is built to defend us from dying and that is why there possesses an immune system. The immune system comprises the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. In this post, I will be looking into the innate immune system but before I continue, let me do a fast touch on the adaptive arm of the immune system. The adaptive immune system is a specific response immune system that targets specifically a pathogen destroying the pathogen which it senses as foreign but on the other hand, the innate immune system isn't specific. It attacks pathogens without any specific target to one type and it doesn't keep a memory of whatever pathogen it attacks and it is the first line of defense for the body. So let's do the innate system.

However, as far back as 1875, Charles Darwin's groundbreaking work in his book 'Insectivorous Plants' challenged conventional notions about plant behavior and opened scientists' eyes to a whole new understanding.

#### Vitamin D and Rickets

In the 17th century, a condition called Rickets emerged in England, primarily affecting children. This disease had existed prior to the industrial revolution, but the changing times played a significant role in its prevalence.

The skin, being the largest organ in the human body, is often overlooked when it comes to observing and understanding changes that occur in it. In Nigeria, for example, many people focus on trying to lighten their skin, but not necessarily on monitoring changes in their skin. However, physicians pay close attention to the skin and evaluate any alterations that may occur, as these changes can sometimes provide valuable diagnostic insights.

While some skin changes may be benign variations and not indicative of a specific disease, they can still be used as differential indicators during medical assessments. It is crucial that if you notice any changes in your skin, you promptly seek advice from a medical practitioner or visit a hospital for proper evaluation. Now, let's examine some skin changes and their possible indications

Unless you are unfamiliar with the concepts of chemistry and poisoning, you must have heard of the word ""cyanide."" Cyanide is a molecule composed of a Carbon atom bound to a Nitrogen atom via a triple bond. If you're still struggling to grasp its nature, let me help break it down for you.

In nature, cyanide exists as a salt, binding to alkaline metals like sodium to form Sodium Cyanide and potassium to form Potassium Cyanide. It can also bind to glycosides. In regions like Nigeria, where garri (Cassava Flake) and groundnut (Peanut) are staple foods, there have been warnings about the risk of cyanide poisoning.

Bioterrorism is when there is an intentional release of biological toxins or agents, these agents are released to majorly harm or kill animals, plants, or even humans. Whenever there is a threat of biological warfare, it appears remote to most developing and industrialized nations and is used by extremists as a weapon against civilian populations.

I recently paid a visit to a friend, and during my visit, I learned about a concerning incident involving one of his neighbors who had overdosed on tramadol. It's disheartening to observe that an increasing number of young individuals are falling victim to tramadol overdoses, making it a drug of significant concern. Tramadol, a commonly prescribed analgesic, possesses dual properties as an opioid and a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).

The opioid effect of tramadol is primarily attributed to one of its metabolites called O-Desmethyl-cis-tramadol (ODS). Users of this drug are typically well-acquainted with its pain-relieving properties. While tramadol primarily affects monoamines, the combination of its opioid and SNRI components contributes to pain relief and mood alterations.

In cases of injury, the concern over bleeding and the need for blood to clot become paramount. While a necessary process to prevent excessive bleeding at the site of injury, clotting can take a dangerous turn if it occurs within a blood vessel, distant from the initial injury, potentially leading to significant blood loss. Striking the right balance is crucial because, in the world of clotting, both too much and too little can have dire consequences.

Blood clot is controlled in the body, and while too much is bad as it can lead to blood clotting in bloodstream which could cause the blocking of blood vessels and could cause other serious conditions such as organ damage, too little is also bad as a person can keep bleeding when there is a cut. People with genetic disorders such as Hemophilia suffer from little blood clotting while people with thrombophilia suffer from too much clotting.

The name elephantiasis was coined based on the fact that the affected skin region could get hard and have the resemblance of an elephant's skin. It is more common in tropical and subtropical regions.

The placenta is an instrumental organ whose functions are short-lived, it actively connects the growing baby in the womb to the uterus during pregnancy. Shortly after pregnancy, the placenta develops and gets attached to the uterus wall, connecting the baby to the placenta is the umbilical cord. This makes the placenta as well as the umbilical cord, the baby's lifeline while it is in the uterus. 

At the end of the first trimester, the placenta takes over the production of hormone, before this time, the *corpus leteum* is usually responsible for the handling of the hormone production. For most pregnant women, the first-trimester symptoms of fatigue and nausea will disappear the moment the placenta takes over completely usually in the second trimester.

Probably, when you hear about someone pulling out his or her hair, you may begin to wonder if that doesn't seem abnormal, of course, it isn't completely normal because it could be a sign of a disorder which is called, **Trichotillomania**.

Trichotillomania is a mental health condition otherwise known as hair-pulling disorder, the process is a constant, repeated, and irresistible urge to pull out hair from the eyebrows, scalp, and other areas in the body. This urge is highly irresistible because even when the affected patient tries to stop, he cannot control himself.

Our body is very unique, and as unique as every part of our body is, there is very little that so many people know about it, so in this post, I will be looking at certain parts of our body, and will be discussing some incredible facts about them that you may not know in the past.


Let's begin with the heart, the tireless organ responsible for pumping blood throughout our lives. While we understand its fundamental role, did you know that if the heart is removed from the body, it can continue beating autonomously for approximately 3 minutes? This remarkable feat is attributed to the heart's ability to self-excite (Sinoatrial node), operating independently of the brain. Even in cases of head injuries affecting the brain, the heart can persist in beating, sustaining life even when direct signals from the brain are disrupted. Over a lifetime, the human heart pulsates an astonishing 2.5 to 3 billion times, propelling around 2000 gallons of blood daily or an astounding 55 million gallon","{""image"":[""https://live.staticflickr.com/4907/45733811415_968f8e3eb7_b.jpg"",""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/730_Posterior_View_Skull.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:730_Posterior_View_Skull.jpg"",""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Human_eye_anatomy.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Human_eye_anatomy.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""neoxian"",""appreciator"",""spt"",""proofofbrain"",""waivio"",""cent"",""alive"",""stemgeeks"",""stemng""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.37-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[""1.3230"",""1.2837"",0,""0.9000"",0]}",2023-12-13 01:37:39,Unveiling the Marvels Within: A Journey through the Intricacies of the Human Body,/hive-196387/@ireti/unveiling-the-marvels-within-a,1

Dinitrophenol, commonly known as DNP or 2,4-Dinitrophenol, once had a controversial stint in the early 1930s, being discussed for its potential in weight loss. However, today, the tables have turned, and it stands as a prohibited substance within the human domain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) categorizes 2,4-Dinitrophenol as an industrial chemical, finding its application in herbicides, dyes, wood preservation, and, curiously enough, explosives.

Acute agitation is one condition that would always cause a doctor or nurse's text page to come up. Most patient's that suffer from acute agitation are usually agitated and not redirectable making it difficult for medical practitioners to get vitals.

Ah, the topic we can't escape - poop! It can either be the highlight of your day or a total nightmare, depending on which side of the coin you find yourself on. Regardless of our personal feelings, we can't deny that the act of expelling waste is a fundamental aspect of our lives, and when things go awry, it's impossible to overlook.

Passing out feces actually might look simple, but there are a lot of things to consider and you would be so surprise at the number of people who have bowel problems and require the help of a doctor, or a surgery. Some people can experience constipation in a very serious manner that they will require a pace maker which is used to stimulate heart muscles to control their bowel movements. To avoid finding yourself in the hospital looking for a savior to get that poop out of your system, then follow my instructions.

Pregnancy triggers a remarkable transformation in a woman's body, orchestrated by the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Not only do these hormonal changes play a pivotal role in pregnancy, but they also set the stage for the production of breast milk. In this post, we delve into the fascinating journey of how a woman's body produces this precious nourishment for her newborn.

While a woman is pregnant, her body begins to change and when she is getting towards the period of childbirth, another hormone starts to get released in increased amount in the body known as prolactin which is responsible for the milk production.

In our intricate human anatomy, every body part holds its own significance, even those that have been categorized as seemingly obsolete due to evolutionary changes. Among these often-dismissed body parts are the auricular muscles in the ear.

Some individuals possess the rare ability to wiggle their ears ever so slightly. These auricular muscles were once integral for tracking sounds. These muscles are found in various animals, including dogs, cats, apes, and monkeys. In the past, our ancestors could manipulate their ears to some extent in response to sounds. However, this ability has diminished over time due to evolution, and these muscles are now considered vestigial. While they may not visibly move in response to sounds, studies have revealed that the brain areas associated with these muscles exhibit activity when we hear sounds.

Our bodies hold lots of misconception, and we just want to believe in those misconception but today, I will like to differentiate facts from misconceptions, and truth from myths.

Let's start with the notion that a significant amount of body heat escapes through our heads. You've probably heard that up to 40-45% of heat loss occurs via the head, making you wonder just how hot your cranium might be. However, this isn't entirely accurate. The truth is that our heads lose heat much like any other part of our bodies. Studies from the University of Manitoba have revealed that we lose approximately 7-10% of body heat through our heads, primarily because it's one of the most exposed areas.

Tragically, this cow succumbed to its mysterious ailment a few months later. It wasn't until September 27, 1985, that pathologists unveiled the unsettling truth – Cow 133 had died of Spongiform encephalopathy, later christened Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or, as we commonly know it, mad cow disease.

The human kidney, often regarded as a simple filtration organ, holds a wealth of functions vital to our well-being. Beyond its role in producing urine, the kidney plays a crucial part in regulating blood pressure, fluid-electrolyte balance, hormone secretion, and detoxification. In this post, we'll delve into the multifaceted world of this bean-shaped wonder.

It is true that the kidney is responsible for filtering blood, but do you know how much blood the kidneys can filter? Well, it can filter up to 190 liters of blood daily. The kidneys, located on both sides of the vertebral column from the region of the 12th thoracic vertebrae to the third lumbar vertebrae with the right kidney being a little lower than the left kidney because the liver takes a big part of space. The upper portions of the kidneys are covered by the 11th and 12th ribs, and if these ribs are fractured, they could affect the kidneys.

Gone are those days when medical doctors and scientist were just making guesses when it came to treating people. I mean the days of using the believe of when a person is sick, it is because the liquid in their body are not in equilibrium, so there need to be a leak in blood, or those other nasty experience that people had then. In our world now, it is believe that every medical step that is taken should be rooted in scientific research and proves but is this true? Are so many medical terms scientifically proven, or let's say they just had to implement some of those things for lack of knowing what to do?

Owning a pet has become a common feature in many households today. People embrace the companionship of domesticated animals, which typically includes dogs, cats, rabbits, and various other furry creatures. Some even consider hens as pets, though this classification can be a bit perplexing. In this post, we'll delve into some intriguing facts about dogs that you might not be aware of.

Humans have shared their lives with animals for thousands of years, with the practice of animal domestication dating back as far as 30,000 BC. The origins of the relationship between humans and dogs remain somewhat mysterious, whether wolves found humans or humans discovered gray wolves is still a subject of debate. Nonetheless, it's clear that dogs are descendants of wolves, and over time, they have evolved to coexist and communicate with humans. In the process of this evolution, dogs have developed new facial muscles that endear them to humans, often resulting in those irresistible puppy dog eyes.

When a person suffers from epileptic seizures, especially intermitent ones which look almost constant at all times. Surgery is always adviced because there is a part of the brain that is firing unendingly. The operation to cure epilepsy has to do with identifying and cutting out the portion of the brain that is firing abnormal electrical signals triggering the seizure. If the portion of the brain isn't found easily, then a more invasive procedure can be performed to help remove the portion of the brain responsible. While this looks very simple and has been successful for a lot of people, there was a case where an epileptic seizure operation led to allowing a part of the body functioning by itself.

I once had a conversation with someone, urging her to appreciate the ability to laugh without any health complications. It's something many of us take for granted, but the truth is, there are people out there who can't share in the simple joy of laughter without facing dire consequences. Today, let's delve into the intriguing world of why such a phenomenon occurs.

You might not know that cases like this exist but they do. A case is that of Tracy Herring who temporarily becomes paralyzed anytime she laughs. She says laughter causes her neck to weaken. She would lose control of her limbs and become paralyzed on the left side, lasting for a few seconds or minutes. Her condition began at the age of 32 and it began when she couldn't feel her arms while laughing and drinking red wine at a party.

Our olfactory senses can detect an array of scents, ranging from the sweet to the putrid, the fresh to the pungent. These aromas are composed of intricate chemical compounds.

Have you heard of the fungus ""Whiskey Fungus""? Just as we humans like drinking different alcoholic beverages from whiskey, Rum, Cognac, Vodka, and so on, while people like me do not take them at all, people who know their drinks like the distilleries but so are fungi.

Fungi, a group of organisms distinct from plants, can take the form of unicellular or multicellular entities. While we often associate them with mushrooms and toadstools, their variety extends far beyond. These organisms, fueled by saprophytic nutrition, secrete digestive enzymes onto food materials, absorbing the resulting nutrients. Fungi can wield both beneficial and harmful influences, with yeast and trichophyton serving as prime examples.

So, there are some plants that can be very harmful to us, infact, some of them you would not expect to see them on this post because you never thought of them as harmful and that's because you have never been curious to give it a try (Warning: Please do not give any plant you are not certain about its consumption a try.)

Depression is a complex medical condition that elicits various thoughts and emotions in different individuals. From feeling down and listless to struggling with appetite and... c'mon tell me other things you believe make a person depressed. Surprisingly, depression affects approximately 3.8% of the global population, with adults making up around 5% of this staggering statistic. Over the years, our comprehension of depression has evolved, with new approaches and treatments emerging with each passing decade.

In the past, depression was often viewed solely as a mental illness, leading patients to be admitted to asylums. Aggressive methods like lobotomies were even employed to tackle severe cases, while the 1930s witnessed the advent of Electroconvulsive therapy as a treatment. As time progressed, cognitive therapy took the stage in the 1960s, offering new hope for managing depression.

Did you remember the antibiotics that started the journey of antibiotics? I am talking about penicillin, the antibiotic that was discovered by Scottish physician Alexander Fleming. I need to give that guy an award for saving my life a number of times, actually, not literarily saving my life, I mean for being the person to notice the superstar mold known as penicillin which has played a role in increasing our lifespan by about 10 years.

Before you begin asking, I was going to tell you what antibiotics are. Antibiotics are selective poisons that attack bacteria thereby killing them completely, or slowing their growth. They are also known as antimicrobials so if you hear someone saying that, don't look like they just said something out of the ordinary.

Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is a widely recognized and commonly used pain relief medication. It holds a significant market valuation of 9.8 billion dollars as of the end of 2022. It's safe to say that almost everyone has taken paracetamol at some point in their lives, considering its accessibility as an over-the-counter drug.

During my upbringing, I observed adults taking paracetamol at various doses, with some opting for 500mg, most taking 1g, and a few going up to 1.5g in a single dose, reaching a daily intake range of 1.5 to 4.5g. Many individuals would obtain paracetamol without a prescription from a doctor or pharmacist due to its easy availability. However, I want to emphasize the importance of using medications only under the guidance of a medical practitioner, particularly a physician.

You've probably heard the saying, 'What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.' This is often applicable to diseases, as our immune systems have the remarkable ability to recognize and combat foreign pathogens they've encountered before. However, there are instances where surviving an event can actually leave a person weaker than before.

Our immune system is designed to protect us from a wide range of pathogens and disease-causing agents that constantly surround us. If one of these agents manages to infiltrate our body, our immune system springs into action by releasing cytokines and activating immune cells. Lymphocytes play a crucial role in this process, signaling the brain that the body is under attack, triggering a survival response.

While we cannot confirm whether former President Obama ever received a Ricin Letter bomb, the seriousness of this poison cannot be ignored.

Poison, is something a lot of people are familiar with. I was seeing a movie today, and someone in the movie was trying to poison a person with a powdered substance. At the end of the movie, it was said to be a poison from a natural plant. My sister was surprised that natural plants could be poisonous but then I explained to her what she needed to know about poison.

I started taking her to 1978 when Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer working for the BBC in London was poisoned with ricin. The poison started with pain in his ankle as a result of a hit from the tip of an umbrella. It looked like an accident at first, but over time it was certain it was an assassination.

Best Before, Best Buy, Expiry Date, or whatever language you see on labels identifying the expiration date of a good, especially with food items has drawn a lot of controversies. I was at the supermarket two days ago, and I saw a woman who was going to tear down the building because the store still had on their shelf good that was going to expire in a week's time. She was consistently making claims that the store was going to sell items that were not good for her health and were intended to poison her. There was a scene there and it got me to start wondering, what exactly does buy before mean, and it is really true that goods that already reach their buy before date are poisonous to us?

To continue, let's first understand the pathophysiology of vomiting.

Vomiting center is in the medulla with M1 and H1 receptors. This receptors can be stimulated by different pathways such as the cerebral cortex which is responsible for sending signals of sight and smell, and that is why when you see, smell, or think of something bad, you immediately want to vomit causing nausea known as Anticipatory Emesis. Another way is through the vestibular nuclei which could be triggered by motion in the form of motion sickness.

The word Vascular refers to the blood vessel, and there are three types of blood vessels which are the Capillaries, Arteries, and Veins. You must have been thought this in your elementary biology. The arteries are muscular for the purpose of withstanding blood pressure, and they are also elastic so they can be able to maintain the blood pressure. Veins are the next vessels which are less muscular with high compliance and the capillaries are single layered, thin vessels which are close to the muscles to be distributed blood and they are responsible for the diffusion of nutrients to and away from the tissues. The vessels are made up of the Tunica intima, Tunica media, and Tunica adventitia but there are difference in the thicknesses of the wall. The tunica intima is the inner layer of the vessel made up of the endothelium, basal lamina, and sub-endothelial layer. There is an internal elastic lamina between the innermost tunica intima and the Tunica media.

A virus gets into a cell by binding to the host cell's receptors. The receptor can defer depending on the type of virus and the type of enzymes used to reproduce either its own enzymes or that of the host. The virus cell such as HIV attaches to specific receptors in the host cell such as CD4 cells. HIV Virus usually tricks the CD4 receptor which usually binds to MHC Class 2 to activate T-helper cells to think that its substrates are the same as that of MHC Class 2.  The Virus is then absorbed into the cell either by endocytosis of the viral particle or by bacteriophage injecting the DNA or RNA. In the cell, the virus will undergo uncoating releasing its nucleic material followed by protein and nucleic acid synthesis where the virus starts to use the mitochondria to produce more viral cells. 

Antiviral drugs target specific regions in the process of reproduction and we should start with the absorption phase first.

Tuberculosis is a very infectious chronic disease that is caused by *Mycobacterium Tuberculosis* which is treated over a long period of time and could take months or years. Tuberculosis lesion is fibrotic preventing the penetration of the drug. Tuberculosis drugs can be divided into **First-line Tuberculosis Drug** and **Second-line Tuberculosis Drug**. First-line tuberculosis drugs are the first, cheap, and very effective, with decreased dose toxicity. These drugs include Isoniazid, Rifampin, Streptomycin, pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol.

Today, still on pharmacology, we will be continuing with another Beta Lactam drug, and this time we will be discussing Cephalosporins. So let's begin without wasting any time.

Cephalosporin is another type of Beta-Lactam drug that contains the Beta-lactam rings that are available in Penicillin, a dihydro thiazine ring, and an acetyl side chain. This drug has a fungal origin but there are also semi-synthetic forms now available. Similar to Penicillin they are bactericidal as they attack cell wall synthesis, inhibiting the cell walls of bacteria. Also, they have the same resistance mode as Penicillin. Cephalosporin although similar to penicillin, they have some pathogens that they do not act upon such as Chlamydia, mycoplasma, Enterococci, and Listeria.

Before I continue, let me quickly explain to you that antibiotics are compounds that inhibit the growth or kill microbes basically bacteria. Let's start the Beta-Lactam antibiotics.

Beta-Lactam antibiotics possess Beta-Lactam rings, and for clarity, Lactam is a cyclic amide, so Beta-Lactam is a square-shaped structure that possesses the Carbonyl group and an amide group where the nitrogen atom is attached to the beta carbon close to the carbonyl group. In the case of penicillins, they can possess a sulfur group such as Thiazolidinedione. The bonds of the square shape molecule are often undtable and bonds between the Amide and the Carbonyl ","{""image"":[""https://live.staticflickr.com/7310/9197047813_d5e78312cb_b.jpg"",""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Simple_penicillin_mechanism.png"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Simple_penicillin_mechanism.png""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemng"",""stemgeeks"",""neoxian"",""waivio"",""cent"",""alive"",""bee"",""science"",""penicillin""],""description"":""In my previous posts, I looked at toxicology, taking different types of poisoning from vegetable acid poisoning, organic poisoning, animal poisoning, Inorganic acid and base poisoning, and Inorganic metallic"",""app"":""ecency/3.0.31-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[1,1.6666666666666667,0]}",2023-04-04 17:23:48,Pharmacology - Penicillin and Penicillin Mechanism,/hive-196387/@ireti/pharmacology-penicillin-and-penicillin-mechanism,1

 **Mercury** also known as quicksilver is a bright silver-luster liquid metal that exists in both a metallic form and sulfide form. Mercury is not poisonous in its metallic form since it is not absorbed but it is poisonous in its vaporized form which is either inhaled or has contact with the skin. Mercury combines with the sulfhydryl groups in enzymes to become toxic.  Mercury can be gotten from Mercuric chloride (which is a white crystalline powder), Mercurous Chloride/subchloride (Amorphous), Mercuric Oxide, Mercuric cyanide, Mercury Nitrate, and organic mercury compound (found in fungicides). Mercuric Chloride is the main poison that causes acute poisoning.

Fat! Carbohydrate!! these class of food has been the topic of a lot of arguments and while people are saying one is bad while the other is better. Some are even looking to understand which is worse of the two classes of food. We have always heard people say fat is very bad for our body. I remember my mum engaging in a fight with someone who sold fat for her in the market instead of red meat. It was a very bad experience, as she maintained that it was very bad for our health and the man was intentionally giving her something bad for her health and that of her family. I guess she had every right to feel bad but then she would always make us take carbohydrates, and rarely complained about sugar.  Before I continue, let me ask you the question Fat or Sugar, which is not good health-wise?

We are complex beings and we didn't fall from the sky, it all started from a single sperm and egg fertilization. After fertilization, at about 40 weeks, a life is created and this all started from a single cell which evolved to become a baby which is born. At the month of birth, babies experience a surge of adrenaline that is more intense than when a person is having a heart attack. This adrenaline helps the baby take its first breath since its lungs are still filled with amniotic fluid. That adrenaline helps to take the first of about 700 million breaths or more that would be taken in a lifetime. This breath allows air to get into the body through the Alveoli taking in oxygen into the blood and taking out carbon dioxide, and it is at this point that the mother is detached from the mother through the cutting of the Umbilical cord.

Sleep is one activity that we are supposed to participate in, no matter our color, race, and believes. We are supposed to sleep of about one-third of our entire life but a lot of us, in the race to get a better life for ourselves, and some people having sleep disorder, a lot of people have become sleep deprived. I start to ask myself, what happens when a person is deprived of sleep?

It is not news that in decades now, sleep hours have reduced by 1 to 2 hours and I think I can testify to it. While we have a recommendation of 7 to 8 hours night sleep time, a lot of us do not even have 5 hours sleep anymore. This reduction in seep hours can be as a result of insomnia, of work shift, like in my area where there are a lot of factories and those factories function all day and night, with people doing night shifts.

Without any doubt, I love carbohydrate foods. In fact, is it possible to have a meal in a day without eating carbs, it is no news that news media and numerous articles talk about the danger of carbohydrates to our health saying they are more dangerous than saturated fats, or that they increase heart disease risk? While I love carbs a lot, I try to find answers to whether they are actually a killer class of food, and whether can I reduce my carbohydrate intake. You know, carbs are very difficult to avoid especially when you intend to eat cheap food or junk food. When you are asked what food contain carbohydrate, you might start to say Biscuit, bread, and Wheat but do not be shocked when I say that your favorite Brocolli and Beans also have carbohydrate in them.

Actually, a friend invited me to a party over the weekend but I turned down the offer because I didn't want to spend my entire day at a party, thereby preventing me from getting the proper rest I needed. That doesn't mean I do not like parties because I am the life of the party but I just needed the weekend to myself, and while I enjoyed my weekend, I hope you did the same on your end, and welcome to a new week.

I was reading about plants about two days ago, and I came across numerous plants that caught my eye and got my undivided attention. I thought that when it came to plant biology or botany, science should have gotten all figured out moreover, isn't it just plant, but that's not true.  While going through, one plant got me asking questions and awed at the same time, that plant is known as *Boquila trifoliolata*. Now, depending on your region, you might know it by the common name pilpil, voqui but be sure that this plant is found in the temperate regions of Argentina and Chile, so do not worry if you haven't come across it in your lifetime. If you wonder what is special about this plant, it is the fact that it blends in with its floral neighbors. Not like the chameleon blending, I mean a full type of blending where it literally changes its leaves to copy its floral neighbor's leaves.

When we take food, water, soda, and every other edible into our body, we expect that we will be able to expel waste from the body. In cases where there are difficulties in removing these wastes, it might be a result of several clinical conditions which include; Hirschsprung's disease, Colorectal cancer, Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Rectal prolapse, Fecal incontinence, Rectocele, Anal stenosis, Bowel obstruction, and so on. In today's post, I will be looking at one of these conditions and that is Bowel obstruction.

Just as its name implies, a bowel obstruction is a blockage in the intestine, preventing the passage of food, fluid, and gas through it. The obstruction can occur in both small and large bowel but it common is small bowel than in large bowels. It is as a result of gas and fecal matter buildup in the intestine. This obstruction can lead to the dilation of the intestinal region proximal to the obstruction, and cause back pressure which coul cause vomiting.

The testicles also known as the testes are located in the scrotum of males. It is about the size of a large Olive and it is suspended in the scrotal sac by the spermatic cord which contains blood vessels, nerves, and the vas deferens. It is responsible for the production of sperm and plays a fundamental role in the production of the Testosterone hormone.

Testicular cancer as the name implies is cancer that affects the testicles. It is one of the most common types of solid cancer that occurs in males between the age of 15 and 35 years. In 2017, there were 8850 new cases and 410 death in the United States.

We aren't new to tumors, and we know that tumors are abnormal cell growth found in the tissues, and organs of the body. Using agricultural words, we could refer to them as weeds on the farm. I remember my teacher in elementary school telling me that weeds are unwanted plants in an unwanted place and that weeds affect the growth of the main plant itself. In this case, we aren't dealing with weed, we are dealing with tumors, and tumors being abnormal growth can lead to serious and severe conditions as well as death.

Anemia is decreased (not enough), or hypo-functioning red blood cells (hemoglobin). Red blood cells are produced in the bone marrow and are responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body. Anemia can be classified based on the Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), where if the MCV is below 80, it is regarded low MCV, and diseases such as Iron-Deficiency Anemia, Sideroblastic Anemia, and Thalassemia are examples of low MCV anemia.

If we see something we fear to have a negative result, we have the right to as it is a normal phenomenon but it becomes a disorder when it affects the daily activity of a person(s). Anxiety as a disorder is pervasive fear or anxiousness that could interfere with the normal activity of a person. Anxiety disorder could range from General anxiety disorder (which is an anxious feeling for the majority of a person's day lasting for about 6 months), panic disorder (which are brief, but overwhelming fear, terror, or feeling of independent doom which could be accompanied by shortness of breath, and panic attacks, which reoccur for about 1 month), phobia (irrational fear for objects, things, and activities, to the extent of avoiding them with the thought of it impacting their lives), social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder","{""links"":[""https://www.picpedia.org/medical-08/a/anxiety-disorder.html"",""https://www.maxpixel.net/Mental-Disorder-Fear-Anxiety-Depression-Woman-6562668"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917081/"",""https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2016/03/understanding-anxiety-disorders"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6206399/"",""https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2016/03/understanding-anxiety-disorders"",""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/anxiety-what-it-is-what-to-do-2018060113955"",""https://www.statpearls.com/ArticleLibrary/viewarticle/22130"",""https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/medicines-and-psychiatry/ssri-antidepressants/overview/"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554406/""],""image"":[""https://pix4free.org/assets/library/2021-10-13/originals/anxiety-disorder.jpg"",""https://www.maxpixel.net/static/photo/1x/Mental-Disorder-Fear-Anxiety-Depression-Woman-6562668.png""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""science"",""ecency"",""stemng"",""stemsocial"",""stemgeeks"",""anxiety"",""anxiety-disorder""",2023-01-01 19:49:30,Anxiety Disorder and Pharmacology of Anxiety Disorder,/hive-196387/@ireti/anxiety-disorder-and-pharmacology-of,6

As a boss or leader you need to have a significant amount of controlling power over your emotions, this power that you have over your emotions will grant you mastery over your life and prevent you from making decisions that will alter your growth. 

Every major change in life begins with our minds and it begins with our ability to say no to the things we want and yes to the ones that we do not want, the moment you choose to wake up as a leader and set your minds to say no to those things that you will not accept anymore, that is the day that change begins for you. The day you choose to give up on mediocrity, the day you decide to no longer give anyone the power and authority to look down on you ever again, that day things begin to change and then you begin to notice a realistic difference.

When people do not believe in themselves, there is a strong possibility to have them feeling very weak emotionally all the time, the fear of failure is a very big reason why people do not believe in themselves and the fact that you have failed once does not mean it is the end of life, it is rather an avenue to push yourself the more into trying out new things on a regular basis.

Truth is, it is never going to be easy to change from being a lavish spender to someone who is concerned about building a long term wealth, this process is so serious that some people go for therapy to make this change happen.

Moving from a lifestyle of a lavish spender to following a path of wealth building has a lot to do with the mind, work must be done on the mind for there to be a change in an individual’s spending habit. A person who did not grow up with being around much money has a high tendency of spending excessively when he gets the privilege of having money, it all boils down to the environment we grew up in and the type of mind set we have built over time.

This is wrong on all levels as you do not make your money back of an investment within a short period of time, and there is nothing like the perfect stock. Investing is not a way to get rich quick, it is a slowly way to improve your wealth over a long period of time.

The truth is there is only 24 hours in a day and what happens within this short period of time is what we can actually achieve since no one can extend the time.

### Mindset
A lot of people have a mindset that they can’t be millionaires in US Dollars, this mindset sometimes are placed into the mind of the people by the environment they are, the government and many other factors.

Just like so many people earn high paying jobs immediately after college, so many earn low paying jobs while others have to wait for a while before the eventually get a job which falls under the category of a high or low paying job. One thing we need to understand is that either a high paying job or a low paying job, it doesn’t mean that you can’t build wealth. Wealth is determined by input and output of money and it doesn’t matter how much a person make (income), what matters is how the money is used (outcome).

You do not have to lie to your customers for the purpose of making profits, remember that a little customer base can either grow into a large one or get destroyed to nothing through words of mouth, when your customers are able to help","{""app"":""peakd/2020.04.5"",""format"":""markdown"",""tags"":[""entrepreneur"",""business"",""entrepreneurship"",""steemleo"",""steem-leo"",""leofinance"",""leadership""],""links"":[""https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/entrepreneur-character_795832.htm""],""image"":[""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmd3Z9gihNikJeF9nVBpSae6VbmtRJ3pMmBdqJCvvsMcsb/images%20-%202020-05-02T141946.278.jpeg""]}",2020-05-02 13:23:33,An Entrepreneur With a Good Character Makes A Great Team Leader,/hive-175254/@ireti/an-entrepreneur-with-a-good-character-makes-a-great-team-leader,2

A lot of people have predicted so many things and the past and these things were either exceeded or not even looked into as technology improved and innovation continue to rise. It is not a news that human technological advancement has doubled yearly in the last 100 years and increased exponentially 50 years ago after the Apollo mission to the moon. The mission looked like the eye opener to a lot of scientific possibilities.

In this post, I will be trying to look at what would have happen in the next 1000 years to humans if our own technological innovations do not wipe us out. Also, it is visible that we might not be around to witness a few of this but if technology speeds up a little faster or if humans can come up with a solution to longevity, then it is possible that we might witness all of the happening in the future.

 Before covid-19, handshake was a form of gesture practised by every organization and business partners, of course no one will want to have a handshake with anyone this period for the fear of being infected. However, I think it is good for us to learn simple gestures so when the virus totally disappears, we will be able to follow simple gestures. Introduction in business is based on age and rank in authority and it should never have anything to do with gender.
