The work of a vulcanizer might look dirty and not presentable, but it is something you could sit with and earn a living from, it is not just an occupation to be disregarded at all.

A vulcanizer does beyond reparing of deflated tyres, he is very skilled and knows the in and out of tyres.

A vulcanizer breaks and trims broken section of tyres with knifes.

As attractive a the hair seems, it is important for us to know that having a neat hair does not just come on its own, if you leave your hair on its own without taking proper care of it, then do not expect a shinning neat hair. So keeping a neat hair requires an intentional effort.

Here are some things that will help you keep your hair shiny and beautiful.

Eating good food will help you keep your hair strong and attractive, I think the human body is totally connected in some ways and they all have a way of affecting each other, so having  a good meal for the day will help to protect and keep your hair strong and healthy.

bettykatty,the-changing-power-of-money,The Changing Power of Money,money,"Money is something that everyone wants to have because that is what is used as a means of exchange when you do not have money, you have absolutely have nothing to spend or live on.
The effect that comes to the life of a man when he gets money cannot be over mentioned.

Money has the power to make a dull skin begin to shine, it has the power to make a disfigured person get a good and nice shape.

Money can make someone who has a chronic illness become very fine again, money can absolutely make the life of a man very meaningful.

Money, on the other hand, can as well make a man become a monster, money can totally destroy someone's reputation by making the person become a total beast if not properly controlled.
The ability to make money turn a person into a bad individual depends on how well the person has the ability to handle situations properly.

But, today we have women who go through really stressful activities when compared with the men, those women whom circumstances have made them single mothers sometimes because of the unfortunate loss of the father and sometimes even as a result of irresponsible fathers.

Irresponsible fathers leave the upkeep and training of their child/children to the woman, it is in situations like this that the woman who really loves her child/ children will have to take on extra jobs to get things go well for their child/children.

A fellowship that is authentic is a genuine one, one that is from heart to heart,a good fellowship brings about happy relationships.

An authentic fellowship brings about the expression of honest feelings, it strengthens the union or relationship.
During the course of the fellowship, they both discuss about their fears, admit their failures, acknowledge the fact they are weak individuals, ask for help from each other.

In a place of authenticity, there is always an avenue for humility, truth and honesty.

Neighbors are meant to be peace loving and caring people, they are supposed to be people we can always get things from,  people we can borrow things we do not have at the moment.

Neighbors are people we should be able to help out in situations, they should be able to run to us for help.

But, trust me when I say some neighbors can be very annoying. I have this neighbor who can be really frustrating and annoying, the young lady moved into our apartment last two weeks and some time later she came in with her boy friend, at the moment she came with that guy, we had no idea that was the last time we were going to have peace in that house.

Humans need to understand that when we claim to love, there is a level of commitment that is required from it, our ability to truly love others depends to a very large extent how committed we are to the things that will help those that we love to grow.
When we claim to love people it is as well necessary that we understand the high of level of sacrifice that is required by us to make to them.

I gave my heart to loving him, because he showered me with so much love,

He gave me so much gifts, he texts me constantly and he as well gives me numerous calls,

He will not eat if I have not eaten, he gave me all that I asked from him,

Even those things I did not request for, he as well gave them to me,

I told my friends about him, and they all said he was good maybe because of the way he spent on them as well,

Whenever we go out, he always sends me with something for my friends,

Sometimes we even go out with them,

And he spends to a reasonable amount,

Today, I was at home alone since I could not travel home to stay with my family as I still had an examination to write, I woke up hungry today but I still had a lot of things to do, so cooking was not the first thing on my agenda.

I washed my dirty clothes one after the other, washed the dirty dishes I had and I carefully arranged them in my plate rack, swept and mobbed my room in order to get rid of any form of dirt whatsoever.

The guy is a really cool guy but the only problem I have with him is that he smokes and drink too often, he is almost an addict even if he claims not be an addict.

I stayed in my room almost throughout the day and later in the evening I decided to relax a little bit, I was not feeling sleepy so I went to my neighbor's store to say hello to her and check out how the market was going for her.

Dear diary I found out about something rather strange today and I did not know that things like that still exist. 
You remember my new neighbor, the woman with a kid that I told you about yesterday?

I went to see her this morning when I was leaving for school and I told her I was going out and I will see her later, when I returned home from school and I still found her in her room, I asked if she did not go to work or something and she said no.

There is and a vacant room in our compound and no one has been staying there for a while now but luckily for us, someone came in and said she liked the house but the bill was too high for her.

My landlord was considerate and he reduced the price for her, she moved in immediately and she had a cute little baby. Her belongings were not much she had only a few properties.

Dear diary, how are you doing today, hope you are feeling relaxed as always since you have nothing else to do than to keep my secret safe.

My friend has been complaining of a constant backache for a long period now, it has become a normal story we even hear every day. He has taken pain relief and some type of drugs prescribed by a pharmacist but all to no avail, as he regularly goes through pain.

Dear diary, a pleasant evening to you I have been carrying my hair around for some weeks now because I just felt I should leave it unmade for a while.

Constant combing was now even becoming another work for me, so I thought I should just make a style that is very simple but nice as well, I did not want to spend much as I did not even have much to spend so I bought just one attachment and took it to my hair stylist and she thought of a great idea.

The hair turned out to be more pretty than I thought it would be and I liked the simplicity and unique","{""tags"":[""diary"",""blog"",""nigeria"",""africa"",""life""],""image"":[""https://steemitimages.com/0x0/http://www.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_6/public/feature/images/my_diary.jpg?itok=7iunuWOC&amp;c=7d4489825c066adc2bb3680021d5327"",""https://i.onthe.io/vllkyt1nbhbhj9f7qo.d438731e.jpg""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwje_7nNh9DWAhXL1BoKHagoBcoQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailystar.net%2Fshout%2Flife%2Fhow-the-pages-diary-turn-years-go-1446013&psig=AOvVaw3hxk8hXm1xWpnmdFU88mPW&ust=1506969023368638"",""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=imgres&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjB2OvDgN3WAhXDWRoKHU8rDqwQjRwIBw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.naij.com%2F1119586-nigerian-cornrow-hairstyles-2017.html&psig=AOvVaw3-aUbq__xYnTGyk-sUpIEE&ust=1507413903281375""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-10-06 22:07:30,My Lovely Diary: I Made My Hair Today,/diary/@bettykatty/my-lovely-diary-i-made-my-hair-today,0

His name is Lanre and he is my classmate, the only time he remembers me is whenever he needs something from me is when he will remember me.

He will have so much money and he will not even remember me I will see him with other ladies spending money lavishly when I check his Instagram page I usually see him with lots of ladies and so many of his friends in big clubs and hotels spending money unnecessarily.
During those times of spending, he will not remember me at all and I will as well just observe him from a distance.

It is important to serve others as it as a whole lot of great reward that people do not know about.
Life is more exciting especially when it is lived for others, but this is one reality that so many people do not want to admit as they believe that they should be the one served instead.

The act of service is one act that might be very difficult because people do not want to learn it as they seem uninterested about it. The most important thing that we need to learn as humans is that we need to start adding value to the community and everyone around us.

The act of service to humanity is to be able to sacrifice for people around us, service is what makes us important and relevant to our community at large.
Service gives you an edge over everyone and everything around you. Service is a reasonable act of giving all you have into something positive.

You are my blanket, Do not let me feel cold at night;
It's not as if we are the best people but we are the best couple;
 It's not as if we do not quarrel at all, We do have differences that we resolve among ourselves;
 It's not as if you are the richest person on earth but I just love you for whom you are;
 You are my blanket, Do not let me feel cold at night.

Your absence will make me feel lonely and bored;
Without you around to keep me warm all through the night, the night is like a year
I want to feel your touch, gentle and firm;

For real, this friend of mine works hard indeed and doesn't even have time for himself and his family but it is really absurd when you have to avoid bathing for a while because of the nature of your job. 
I tried convincing him the day I found out that he needs to have his bath regularly to enjoy a better living, I gave him some reasons why it is important to have healthy bath at all times.

She was not sure if he felt the same way but she was ready to move on with it no matter what happens, the fact that he has a very big house and a range rover car makes her wish she could just get married to him that very day. 

Her friend Becky noticed how crazy she had began to get over this new guy and advised that she should take things slow,she advised that she should get to know this new guy properly before she gives her heart to him. But she replied her friend and said: I understand the fact that you do not know what it feels like to date a rich guy because all the guys you have been with cannot even feed themselves properly not to talk of feeding you, so let me enjoy this moment for as long as it lasts.

It is even believed that women are the ones who get emotional at every slight circumstance, some people believe that a man has the right to be in a relationship with more than one lady but a lady does not have the right to go into a relationship with more than one guy , all this and many others are some of the reasons why I believe that the world we live in is a man's world.

I was having a little chat with a friend of mine today when my brother came in and said we were gossips. I was not happy about it so I asked him immediately what he meant by saying we were gossiping but he said we were gossips because he was sure we were talking about another person's life issue.

If talking about another person's life issue is gossip, then what is not gossip? who has not been gossiped about then?

When the situation is closely examined, you will discover that the problem would have been avoided if the both parties just learn to let the whole issue slide.

I know of people who always love to win arguments and who hate to feel cheated so they argue their hearts out and end up fighting at the end of the day which is usually a very sad situation.

We lack proper rest most times because we want more money, more fame, more good things of life, so we invest more of our time into the pursuit of those things and we put rest aside.
Rest is one factor that is really lacking in our society and it should not be so, because lack of rest causes illness and too much stress to the body.

Ways to become a generous person by adding value to others are ;

* Learn to treat everyone with respect.

* Learn to listen and understand people's feeling before you make conclusions.

* You need to work on self development: You cannot give what you do not have, so you have to continually build and develop yourself.

I see people who are wealthy in their big cars, nice cars and clothes and I just wish I could have some of this things within a twinkle of an eye.

I have learned the hard way that there are some things that money cannot buy, just like people.
No matter how stubborn we think we are, we will in one way of the other need someone to help us though life.

It is an act of using a resource more than you actually require.

Destroying properties could as well be described as an act of being wasteful.

Time spent on unproductive things could also be regarded as waste.

I have seen so many Nigerian women who go to religious centers to pray for children. A few of them even go as far as preparing herbs to drink so as to conceive a child. The joy of every woman is the joy of motherhood and so most women want to have a child they can say is theirs.

In Africa, Nigeria to be precise, A woman who can not bear a child for her husband has no place in the home. Seriously I do not support that but the truth is Most of this women do not even know their Ovulation period. Most of them go for vigils where they are supposed to be doing what is right at home.

## OVULATION
When we say Ovulation, it is when a mature egg is released into the fallopian tube from the ovary, so it can be fertilized by a male sperm.

bettykatty,forgiveness-as-a-way-of-life,Forgiveness as a way of Life,forgiveness,"Forgiveness has over time become an house hold name as it is constantly mentioned every where and at every time.

Forgiveness could be described as an act of letting go of past hurt, it is a decision to ignore what ever wrong someone else might have done to you and then learn to love the person all over again.

The act of forgiveness could either be toward one self or towards other people.

There are times when forgiving yourself might seem like a difficult task because you have expected much more than what you have done.

Forgiving others is a way to let go of anger, hurt and pain.

Sometimes, forgiveness might really be difficult to practice because the person who hurt us might have done something really un pardonable.

But, as often as forgiveness is preached, it still remains something that is difficult to practice. I discovered recently that there are some advatages that forgiveness has to offer and some of them are;

There is a natural law that agrees to the word gabbage in, gabbage out as reaping what you sow, or getting the adverse reaction of your action.

### The level of pain a person feel when being cut, depends on how deep the cut is. 

Most people wonder why they get the adverse reaction for everything they do. Well i have always felt the same way, but maybe that was as a child becaue i started understanding the quote ""gabbage in, gabbage out"" from secondary school when i and my friends would lock ourself up in the library while other girls go to the hostel just to read our books and cover the sylabus to a reasonable extent.

When you ask people about greatness it is definite that you are aware of the reply that you will receive because basically everyone wants to acquire greatness and success.

Greatness could be achieved in every area of life ranging from academics to marriage to finance and every area of one's life as it describes leaving a low level to a high and promising one.

Greatness is a factor that cannot be undervalued, as there is no person that will like to constantly remain on a low level.

Beauty describes attraction with good character, the attitude you give to life showcase the real beauty you have got. Facial attraction might really be deceitful as some people have the physical attraction without the good attitude.

Beauty has been abused on several occasions because some individuals believe that they can use their beauty to get whatever they want, they use it to get favour and manipulate things around here and there.

Proper hygiene is paramount in our day to day activities from homes to schools, offices, religious place, medical centers even the road.

Living a clean life is living a long life. Cleaniness is having a surface free from dirt and germs. Bad hygiene is the best way to breed microorganism and increase infection. 

The innability of keeping your environment  and body clen is inviting pathogenic organisms as guests.

I had been brushing my teeth for many years, not knowing i have been brushing it the wrong way until recently. I remembered always having issues with my health most especially my teeth. I had wanted to be a dental doctor, but my love for humanity wanted me to do more which made me opt for medicine and surgery.

## HOW HAVE YOU BEEN BRUSHING YOUR TEETH

I used to brush my teeth as if I am sawing a tree, to and fro, front and back. I've been doing this for a very long period of time and i know most of you do the same. Well this isn't actually the best way to keep your teeth clean, as particles displaced while brushing are transferred to the other teeth rather than cleaning them.

It's been a while since I posted on steemit, I have been going to the morbid anatomy to perform certain practicals on bodies. Like I always say, a surgeon is an artist, he does everything on the skin with care. Hope you remembered me saying I'm not a medical doctor yet, I'm a medical student.

Immediately God created man, he gave him the responsibility of keeping and dressing the garden. The man was given works to do from the day of creation and wasn't meant to be idle.

We are expected to engage in profitable labour in order to continually enjoy the basic necessities of life.

To be blessed by God, we must be willing to work with our hands because God does not bless an idle hand.

When i joined steemit, i saw a steemian known as @papa-pepper and then i felt he would be the grandfather of all pepper gardeners (haha i believe he is). I felt this man is good at farming, maybe pepper that's why he is called @papa-pepper. So i decided to plant pepper seed with the hope that i would also be given a pepper name if it grows.

Leadership is an attitude and a state of mind. It has nothing to do with political position, title or amount in your wallet or bank account. Leadership can not be thought, coached or lectured. You are either a Leader or a follower presently.

Do not get me wrong every leader was once a follower, so you being a follower today doesn't mean you don't have leadership trait in you.

>Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want to be done because he wants to do it. – Dwight D. Eisenhower

Leadership includes the achievement of goals, targets, and giving people the opportunity to exhibit their potentials. 


# WHAT MAKES YOU A LEADER

Most people holding top positions in companies, industries, and the society only occupy those seats but lack leadership traits.

Certain attributes and characters makes a person a good leader, a few of which includes

Then I remembered I and @gbenga spoke on the phone before joining steemit, and he promised to send me a teddy bear if I join steemit.

Seriously @gbenga has proven to be a caring and good steemian to as many people he invites to steemit.

It amazes me to see that a steemian would reward me separately apart from the rewards steemit gives us.

Take a look at the gift and how beautiful it is.

Diebetis is a metabolic disease in which there is high amount of glucose in the blood. Don't let the name make it look so scary.

I would try my best to break things down to the simplest grammar so we can all learn from it.

 Diabetis is usually occur due to inadequate insulin production or inappropriate response of the body to insulin.

There is one thing among others that makes me love medicine and surgery and that's the surgical aspect of it. My first day at the morbid anatomy was fun because I was curious to know and learn how to dissect a human body. 

Dissecting a human body is different from cutting open a game or cutting a chicken body. Every surgeon is an artist, surgeons are very careful with the art they draw on the body of a human so as to prevent unnecessarily tattoos on the body of the patient. Most surgeons have great respect for bodies either alive or dead which is the major reason they treat the body with care.

Hardship means different things to different people because of the taste they have on the subject. Hardship doesn't really mean being financially handicap, it balls down to lifestyle, work, standard of living, relationship and several other things.

Hardship in any form can be frustrating and discouraging as well, it should not be wished on anyone.

> When the going get tough, the tough gets going

On my own part, i have a story to tell you; A true life to be to be precised.

I was born into  family who struggled to survive. We could barely feed twice a day. My father was earning less than $30 monthly, don't ask me if it is true, because where i hail from most people suffer a lot and live below two dollar $2.
