Every business idea can be very attractive or very woeful and disappointing. Business ideas are raw form of thoughts which always look beautiful at first as the entrepreneur is energetic about their thoughts and then something happens, the business never comes to a reality. Why does this happen, why do this people not get their businesses into the real world?

The skin covers the entire surface of the body and serves as a barrier to protect the internal body from external environmental factors.

It is referred to as an abnormal or pathological neurological condition caused by a fluid-filled cavity within the parenchyma of the spinal cord, or the central canal. Normally, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates through the lateral ventricles which are the first and second ventricle to the third ventricle, then to the cerebral aqueduct then to the fourth ventricle before finding its way down to the central canal. The CSF goes to the foramen magendie and exits to the subarachnoid space.

When we mention the disease of the Liver, we mention hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, and when we are asked to list the disease of the Red Blood Cell, anemia cannot be forgotten but today, I am talking about a life-threatening disease that we do not include when we talk about liver and red blood cell disease, and that's Malaria. Malaria is a fatal disease transmitted to Humans and other animals from an infected mosquito. Understanding how malaria becomes a thing isn't a life cycle you are not familiar with, I am not talking about the life cycle of a mosquito which has to do with an egg then a larva, then a Pupa, before we get an adult mosquito, I am talking about how mosquito gets into the body. In this post, I will be looking at Plasmodium Falciparum, as it is the most common type of malaria infection.

Arterial Blood Gases refer to the arterial level of oxygen, carbon, and other gases in the artery confirming if the blood is basic or acidotic. This can be respiratory acid or base or metabolic acid or base, stemming from the lungs or kidney. For instance, if there is excessive carbon dioxide in the lungs the blood will be acidotic or in an acidotic state, and if there is more oxygen and less carbon dioxide, then the blood will be in a basic state. People are always in an acidotic state when sleeping as the breathing level is slower causing the carbon dioxide to be kept more in the lungs, and when they are hyperventilated where the breathing is fast, the person breaths out all the carbon dioxides, leaving the lung to be alkalosis.

Our heart is one organ that works unendingly alongside the brain, to keep us alive.

While a hospital can still keep people who are brain dead since other organs of their body are still functional, this is not possible when the heart stops pumping blood.

Innate immunity is refered to as Natural or Native Immunity which are first defenses against pathogens and foreign bodies in the body where the body's antibody binds to antigen and destroys the antigens. it is the cell's natural way of defensing the body by recognizing the structural features of the pathogen such as lipopolisacharide feature in gram negative bacteria. This immunity is non-specific, it attack all types of pathogens equally. Innate immunity can be divided into first line of defence and second line of defence. The first line of defence includes the Skin and the Mucus membrane which prevents pathogen from getting into the body. The second line of defence is triggered when the first line of defence fails. The Second line of defence include phagocytes, Natural Killer Cells, and Antimicrobial substances, and they help to destroy the antigens that get into the body.

Fat! Fat!! fat!!!, I am sure you have heard so many bad comments on this because it is not healthy. Have you tried telling a current champion of SUMO that their fat is bad for them? There is a possibility that you wouldn't be giving the testimony in sound health. Fat makes up most of our body, stored in the largest organ in our body, the skin. In reality, we cannot live without fat, and most people want to lose fat so desperately. A lot of people go to the gym just to burn down the fat that they have even when they are not obese or do not look like people with fat at all. Actually, there are so many things that we do not tell the random person who is not medically inclined. We do not tell them that fat is needed in our life activity, we do not tell them that fat is released with lots of hormones in our body for our bone development, brain development, and in our reproductive organs.

I used the word unreliable because it is without no doubt that this person doesn't know anything about vaping except for the fact that he is a user. So I will be looking at vaping and its effect on a person's health.

In clubs and bars, or at home, you might have seen people who take E-cigarettes. This has been branded to be better than cigarettes even when it is not. Before you continue, let me state clearly that the lungs were not created for smoke or anything that will cause them to work with stress. That alone is enough reason not to participate in vaping.

Cold is one of the human body natural stressors as an exposure to cold will stimulate a strong physiological response such as the release of catecholamines which are dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine.

You must have heard of Vitamins or maybe you have used some vitamin supplements and you wonder what they truly are. Welcome back to my post, and today we will be discussing Vitamins, why we need them, and how they work from a biochemical point of view.

Before we continue, let's quickly explain what vitamins are. They are small organic molecules, needed by our body in other to carry out regular cellular processes. They are also co-enzymes/co-factors which are used in enzymatic processes. Going back to when they were discovered, they were regarded as vital amines, but this isn't completely true because lots of vitamins aren't even amines. For instance, Vitamin A (Retinol) doesn't have Nitrogen in its structure. So we can refer to them as micro nutrients that are needed by our body to survive.

It is made up of two protein chains consisting of about 529 amino acids in total and it is sourced from a seed which is native to East Africa.Comprising two protein chains, Ricin toxin A and Ricin toxin B, Ricin becomes toxic only when these chains are bound together. For example, Barley grain contains Ricin's protein A toxin, but lacking protein B toxin makes it safe to consume. Protein B toxin plays a crucial role in Ricin's ability to enter cells and cause damage.

Protein, an essential dietary component, is omnipresent in our quest for a healthy lifestyle. Let's unravel the protein saga, exploring its roots, the role of amino acids, and the potential pitfalls when abundance turns into a health hazard.

Th story of looking into proteins started in the 19th century with Vilhjalmur Stefansson sailing to Iceland where he observed that people who lived there fed more on meat and were very healthy but when people in North America switched to eating meat-based diet heavily, they would often become sick as they will experience Nausea and an overwhelming cravings to eat. While both populations consumed meat-based food, the difference was the type of animals they consumed.

Hair loss, or alopecia, is a common concern for many individuals, and the quest for its causes can often lead us down a maze of conflicting information found on the internet. Various theories have emerged, attributing hair loss to factors like over-washing, stress, excessive testosterone, and more. But what's the truth behind these claims, and which should you take seriously?

Actually, hair loss can start from our teenage age, with about 15 to  25% of men suffering from balding before the age of 20 years, about 1 in 4 men suffer hair loss before the age of 30, and about 30 to 50% of men suffer hair loss before the age of 50 years old. Studies have shown that identical twins who are to lose their hairs with do so at the same age.

In our pursuit to develop insecticides and other agents, we have been able to develop some agents that are deadly or injurious to our health, and this is because they are Nerve agents.

Nerve agents, when dispersed, can be fatal due to their insidious assault on the nervous system. They contain chemical inhibitors that target acetylcholinesterase, a crucial enzyme responsible for regulating acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter with a wide array of functions. Acetylcholine plays a pivotal role in transmitting nerve impulses, stimulating salivary glands, influencing the digestive system by promoting the release of digestive enzymes and enhancing gastrointestinal motility. It also affects respiratory muscles and airway diameter and contributes to blood pressure regulation by influencing blood vessel constriction and dilation.

Our brain, often regarded as the most critical organ in our body responsible for cognition and various neurological functions, relies on a complex network of neurons. These neurons depend on proteins to carry out their tasks efficiently. Proteins, known as the building blocks of life, are typically quite reliable, but when errors occur, they can lead to system malfunctions. In the context of brain health, such errors can have fatal consequences. Today, we'll explore Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a rare but life-threatening condition, in a way that's easy to understand.

Our digestive system is a marvel of biological engineering, and understanding its intricacies can shed light on how our bodies process the food we consume. In this post, we'll embark on a journey through the digestive system, exploring its various organs, functions, and processes.

Our digestive journey commences in the oral cavity, where the process of digestion begins. Teeth play a crucial role in mastication, breaking down food into smaller pieces and this is a vital step in physical digestion. As we chew, saliva moistens the food and transforms it into a soft mass known as bolus. This is where amylase in saliva initiates the digestion of carbohydrates. Within the oral cavity, several glands, including the parotid, sublingual, and submandibular glands, produce saliva. Of these, the submandibular gland is the most prolific in generating saliva, followed by the parotid and sublingual glands.

You must have seen videos of people who now inhale Nitrous oxide also known as laughing gas. In case you do not know, Nitrous Oxide is becoming a major threat to the ozone layer and it is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. N<sub>2</sub>O is a colorless gas, made up of Oxygen and Nitrogen and it was first synthesized in 1772 by Joseph Priestly. Soon, due to studies on the gas, scientists confirmed that inhaling it makes people feel light-headed, so they referred to it as laughing gas.

The journey to understanding how the stomach functions began on a fateful day, June 6, 1822, when Alexis St. Martin, a 19-year-old French Canadian, found himself at the wrong end of a musket's discharge. The shot struck his upper abdomen, causing severe injuries that would have likely proven fatal in the absence of modern medical interventions. But this was a different era, with medical science in its infancy.

In our world of advanced technology and innovations, the possibility of him surviving is very low, so his surviving the event was a wonder at that point in time.

If you were posed with the choice between your eyeballs and your eyebrows, many women might lean towards safeguarding their eyeballs, considering that quite a few don't hold a deep attachment to their eyebrows. In fact, some opt to shave them off as part of a fashionable statement. Personally, I find it hard to prioritize one over the other, as I don't engage in eyebrow alterations. This curious trend often leaves me wondering about the motivation behind eyebrow grooming.

Eyebrows, although not as important as the eyeballs which is a major requirement for sight, the eyebrows is entirely not useless. Do you know that it is still possible to identify people in pictures with their eyes blured but it is very difficult to identify them with their eyebrows removed?

You would be thinking that nobody has done it before for a long time, then check again because Kailash Singh and Amou Haji have been able to intentionally not bathe for years.

It is funny enough that so many people now quote Morgan Freeman when arguing this (but C'mon, I am not even sure Morgan has a deep idea on the usage of a petri dish, quoting him in an argument is... let's leave that for now). While these films have captivated audiences with their portrayal of unlocking untapped brain potential, it is essential to separate fact from fiction when it comes to understanding the true capacity of our brains.

There are numerous myths surrounding the human brain, and although we will primarily focus on debunking the 10% brain usage theory, it is worth mentioning other misconceptions, such as the notion that the size of the brain determines intelligence or that we have exactly 100 billion brain neurons. Scientific studies have determined that the number of brain neurons falls within the range of 67 to 86 billion,","{""image"":[""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Basic_structures_of_the_brain_highlighted.png"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Basic_structures_of_the_brain_highlighted.png"",""https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/380000/nahled/das-gehirn.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemng"",""stemgeeks"",""proofofbrain"",""waivio"",""cent"",""bee"",""alive"",""neoxian"",""brain""],""description"":""In this post, we will delve into the popular myth that humans only use 10% of their brain, as perpetuated by movies like \""LUCY\"" and \""Limitless\"".

Proteins serve as the foundation of life, as they constitute the essential components of our bodies, animals, microorganisms, and even viruses. They play vital roles in various biological processes such as food digestion, oxygen transport, and DNA replication. In fact, our DNA itself consists of a series of protein instructions. These proteins are composed of 20 different building blocks called amino acids. Some examples of amino acids include Glycine, Leucine, Tyrosine, Glutamine, Aspartic acid, Serine, Asparagine, Glutamic acid, Phenylalanine, and many more.

In a previous post where we explored **""Memory deterioration, oligomers, and Alzheimer's disease""**, we touched upon the topic of potential treatments for Alzheimer's. Today, let's delve into one of the FDA-accelerated approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease: Aduhelm (Aducanumab). Additionally, we'll briefly discuss the recent full approval of another Alzheimer's drug, Leqembi (Lecanemab) which got its aproval about 24 hours ago, although limited research has been conducted on its efficacy as of yet.

Throughout history, humans have devised various methods to store and preserve information. From ancient stone carvings and scrolls to modern books and digital drives, our quest for preserving knowledge has been ongoing. However, one of the oldest and most remarkable storage devices is the human brain itself. Our brains possess the incredible ability to store memories, recognize objects, and process information efficiently. But as we age, we encounter a problem: our memories don't last forever. We experience forgetfulness, and in some cases, even dementia.

Have you ever noticed the mention of Phenylalanine on the cans of soda you drink? It's something that catches the attention of many people, and you might be curious about why it's written on the cans.

Let's delve into the world of Phenylalanine. It's an essential amino acid, a fundamental building block for our bodies. Our body can't produce it on its own, so we need to obtain it from external sources such as meat, fish, poultry, cheese, sesame seeds, lentils, and peanuts. Phenylalanine plays a crucial role in the body's functioning, serving as a precursor for adrenaline and dopamine. This means that if you do not have these food items and ingest phenylalanine, then you would be deficient in the amino acid.

I was down with malaria for a few days and in this period, I started to ask myself when Nigeria will become a malaria-free country? It's not like it is impossible, as it was in so many countries in the past and today, it looks like the country never had malaria before.

Let me start this post by asking a few questions, and I would appreciate it if you give answers to them, either in the comment section or you just respond to them. Do you donate blood? How often do you donate blood? Why do you not donate? and at what point do you feel morally obligated to donate blood to help a person?

Blood donation is something that is needed beyond the casual thought of donating, as it would save lives but do you know that not everyone can get blood readily available at the hospital?

I was seeing a Nollywood movie titled (Tiger's tail) today, and I saw a young child die from cocaine overdose. This got me worried, as a lot of people have been taking cocaine around the world, and it is so surprising how even children about the age of 12 also take cocaine.

While people take a lot of drugs, cocaine is one of the most used drugs in the world. It is no doubt that Coca leaves have been used in South America for a very long time as both stimulant and medicine. While Coca leaf has its own benefit, the cocaine alkaloid in the leaf is what is regarded today as cocaine which is the drug in it. Cocaine is a drug that is frowned at by all law enforcement agencies around the world, so to understand why it is frowned at, we need to understand what cocaine does to the body.

Microorganisms are found everywhere in our body, we have more microorganisms in our body than our body cells, so we are a carrier of microbes and they have a lot of importance in our body, especially in our intestine. If we were to look at the history of microbes, then it started with Anton Van Leeuwenhoek who built his microscope to view a magnification of 250% to see the lining of cotton but then it was able to see microbes.

Water (H2O), is the second most vital element needed for human life after Oxygen (O2). It is very cool that both contain Oxygen molecules and one can go 3 minutes without oxygen with brain death beginning at 4 minutes. Without water, it can take up to 3 days before people cannot survive again. While Oxygen and water are vital for humans, another element that is vital for human survival is Sodium (Na), then potassium.

Myeloproliferative disorders or you can call it bone marrow proliferation are disorders that are associated with the bone marrow. The Marrow is located in the shaft of long bones such as the femur or the humerus, or in the vertebral bodies, also the bone marrow is responsible for the creation of blood cells in our body from the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells which is a precursor. The bone marrow produces the myeloid stem cells and the lymphoid stem cells. The lymphoid stem cells or lymphocyte makes the B cell, the T cells, and the Natural killer cells. The myeloid stem cells are made up of proerythroblast which become an Erythrocyte (red blood corpuscles), Myeloblast which can divide into three cells which are the Basophils. Eosinophils, Neutrophils, the monoblast which creates the monocyte, and Megakaryoblast which becomes megakaryocytes and these make up the platelets.

Have you imagined what the great depression would have looked like, was it possible that a lot of people were depressed? Having a loss of interest in things in life, a depressed mood, and low energy are what you would notice from a depressed person which is clinically called Major Depressive disorder, or Clinical Depression.  Depression is basically a result of low brain activity, somewhat like when the party in the brain is stopped as a result of brain chemicals that serve as boosters or entertainers. We refer to them as neurotransmitters and these transmitters are Serotonin, Dopamine, and norepinephrine. So when these brain chemicals are released in low quantities or not released.

Lower Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are infections that affect the bladder and cause cystitis which is the inflammation of the bladder commonly caused by bacterial infections which is more prevalent in women than in men. This inflammation of the bladder can go up to the kidney causing Pyelonephritis ( pyelonephritis is a type of urinary tract infection (UTI) that affects either one or both kidneys usually caused by bacteria that enter the urinary tract through the urethra and bladder and then spread to the kidneys).  An article by Martha Medina and Edgardo Castillo-Pino published on [Therapeutic Advances in Urology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4457377/) shows that the lifetime incidence of UTIs is about 50âˆ’60% in adult women.

Have you heard of the Carnivore diet? I do not mean Cannibalism, I am talking about a restrictive type of diet that has to do with exclusive meat, fish, and other animal food products like eggs. The carnivore diet has been cited by a lot of people including American orthopedic doctor Shawn Baker has been able to help people lose fat, and help people with depression, anxiety, arthritis, and diabetes. After reading some articles, I want to do a review. I am not going to be saying that the Carnivore diet is bad or it is excessively good, I will be reviewing both. Using a carnivore diet as an elimination diet for leaky gut and gut inflammation is very beneficial to use of a carnivore diet as it eliminates lectin.

She indicated that she didn't notice any signs even though they were coming up regularly. I remember a time when one of my aunts got pregnant and she claimed she didn't know until my grandma broke the news to her on a visit. My grandma has a way of knowing a woman is pregnant at first sight and can probably guess how old the pregnancy is. I am not here today to discuss my grandma's supernatural powers of identifying pregnancy, it's not like most grandparents in Nigeria do know how to do that, most of them have that supernatural knowledge or skill to identify pregnancy and pregnant women when they see them. In this post, I will be looking at signs of pregnancy in women, Expected Date of Birth or Expected Due Date.

This entire step starts in the brain, specifically the hypothalamus. Do not forget at any time that the hypothalamus is responsible for homeostasis. The hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH or thyroliberin) which stimulates the anterior pituitary to release Thyroid Stimulating Hormone. This hormone trigers the thyroid gland to release T3 and T4 thyroid hormones, and Calcitonin. When a person has hypothyroidism, there is low production of the Thyroid T3 and T4 hormones, and when a person has hyperthyroidism, then there is a high amount of Thyroid T3 and T4 hormone.

Hello friends, today I will be writing on Diabetes 1 and 2.  Let me quickly explain that Diabetes insipidus is a diuretic peeing problem that doesn't have anything to do with Diabetes Mellitus. With diabetes insipidus, there is excessive production of dilute urine and increased thirst as a result of insufficient amounts of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin being produced, which is responsible for regulating fluid balance by controlling how the kidney reabsorbs water which would reduce urine output. One is sugar related, the other is excessive urine and it is amazing how they are both diabetes.

When we eat, the pancreas releases insulin to the blood from the beta cells to reduce the blood sugar level as well as other enzymes that break down the food for energy. To do this, the insulin regulates potassium and sugar in the blood going into the cell, but when there is no food and less energy, the pancreas releases glucagon hormone to break down glycogen in the liver, increasi","{""image"":[""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/3D_medical_animation_still_of_Type_One_Diabetes.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3D_medical_animation_still_of_Type_One_Diabetes.jpg"",""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Depiction_of_a_home_test_for_diabetes%2C_test_results%2C_and_the_%27big_3%27_symptoms_of_diabetes.png"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Depiction_of_a_home_test_for_diabetes,_test_results,_and_the_%27big_3%27_symptoms_of_diabetes.png""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemng"",""science"",""neoxian"",""stem"",""bee"",""waivio"",""alive"",""cent"",""stemgeeks""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.31-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[1.7777777777777777,0,1.5628815628815629,0]}",2023-03-15 09:23:36,DIABETES - Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 and Type 2,/hive-196387/@elity-sitio/diabetes-diabetes-mellitus-type-1,3

Hello, I was talking to a friend yesterday who started lifting weight some months back. When I saw him, he was really big, I mean like the Johnny Bravo type of big. Out of curiosity, I asked if this was the after effect of weight lifting, and he laughed. I became more interested in the sudden increase in body size and to expectation he said he was also taking steroids. I wasn't surprised because I have heard of so many weight lifters taking steroid, but I didn't expect him to take it since he wasn't a full time weight lifter, and wasn't going to be anytime soon.

Hello everyone and welcome to another science write-up from me. Today I will be looking at neurodevelopmental disorders which affect humans. You must have heard of conditions such as Down syndrome, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). If you have, then these conditions are examples of neurodevelopmental disorders. Quickly, what is a neurodevelopmental disorder?

It is a disorder that affects the brain where there are impairments in the activity of the brain such as learning, memory, controlling motor neurons, and social skills which arises when the brain is still at the developing stage either during pregnancy in the fetus or after the birth of the child. To identify if a child has a neurodevelopmental disorder, the child's developmental milestones can be checked. The milestones are activities that the child is supposed to perform at a certain time, such as sitting up, crawling, Babbling, and talking. If the child doesn't perform all these activities or there is a ","{""links"":[""https://picryl.com"",""https://picryl.com/ru/media/cmdr-john-king-assesses-the-reflexes-of-a-cerebral-palsy-patient-at-the-arima-382952"",""https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/cerebral-palsy/conditioninfo/treatments"",""https://www.physio-pedia.com/Physiotherapy_Treatment_Approaches_for_Individuals_with_Cerebral_Palsy"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7082248/"",""https://www.statpearls.com/ArticleLibrary/viewarticle/19188"",""https://tp.amegroups.com/article/view/35534/28329"",""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.738921/full""],""image"":[""https://cdn14.picryl.com/photo/2008/10/28/cmdr-john-king-assesses-the-reflexes-of-a-cerebral-palsy-patient-at-the-arima-382952-1024.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemng"",""stemgeeks"",""cerebral-palsy"",""cent"",""alive"",""proofofbrain"",""waivio"",""science""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.31-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[{""url"":""https://images.ecency.com/p/2nhMph8Yo3jHc59C4HhoD13FuHs1jZWsi3AHfEDHuFit3SgCvKPiafhRrmGwUD1sCkTtn9k",2023-03-05 19:17:24,Neurodevelopmental Condition and Cerebral Palsy in Infant,/hive-196387/@elity-sitio/neurodevelopmental-condition-and-cerebral-palsy,1

Generalized Anxiety Disorder is a disorder where the patient has anxiety for generally everything, from cars, money, phones, health, family, relationship, house, and so on. It can even be so serious that the thought of getting through the day can be very scary. The anxiety is persistent, excessive, and unreasonable as there are no reasons to be worried.

Hello everyone, @elity-sitio is here again and today we will be discussing Shock, and when I mean shock, I am talking about Cardiovascular shock/ Circulatory shock which is a pathological condition where the cardiovascular system collapses causing widespread hypoxia to several tissues of the body. Cardiovascular shock is fetal and is a clinical emergency. We can say that shock is an acute reduction in tissue perfusion which could lead to an imbalance in supply and demand, lactic acidosis, irreversible organ damage, and also death. Shock basically refers to oxygen demand being higher than the oxygen supply.

I was going to discuss Vitamin K2 before, because I had cheese this morning, and cheese has the highest amount of K2 which is responsible for calcium distribution into the bones and teeth. Vitamin K2 and Vitamin D work hand in hand. While Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium in the intestines into the blood while Vitamin K2 takes the calcium from the blood and transports them into the bones and teeth. That is that on vitamin K2 for now, I will do well to take that topic someday and explain the vitamin properly while explaining its relationship with Vitamin D. So today, I will be discussing the Circulatory system in fish. I decided to change my mind because I was discussing with a friend, and she was mistaking opened circulation for closed circulation, only for her to end up saying that fishes exhibit open circulation.  So I decided to do this very fast, but before then, did you know that the study of fish is called ichthyology?

I am a student at the University of Abuja, studying  Microbiology. Growing up as a child, I had this thing for science, and just like every Nigerian child who has this thing for health, we always want to be a doctor but Universities in Nigeria can change that faith very fast even before you begin to live the dream. I am a fun-to-be person, who is also a bookworm. Actually, I am not really a social media person but when I was told that this platform isn't like regular Facebook or other social media platforms rather, it is basically a place where intellects meet to share knowledge and understand different fields.

It is so surprising how much people do not know about health-related topics. I was having a chat with a group of guys today, we were actually discussing weight loss and weight gain. These people are not health professionals, they span from different professions including fashion designers, engineers, sports analysts, podcasters, and two other people who are basic school teachers. While we were having our chat as we often do on Fridays after work,  our discussion diverted toward Eating disorders, and while I was expecting them to say something on the topic even in layman's terms, they asked if there was anything like an eating disorder.

I was shocked, but then I had this thought that most people do not even know about a particular illness, disease, or disorder unless they have to face it firsthand or know who was diagnosed with such.

The liver is a large reddish-brown meaty organ situated on the right abdominal quadrant of the abdomen, we could say that it is specifically at the right hypochondria abdominal region, although its left lobe can touch the epigastric region. It is divided into two lobes, the right lobe, and the left lobe. The right lobe is the larger part of the liver while the left side is the smaller part of the liver. The lobes are divided by a ligament known as the Falciform ligament which connects the liver to the diaphragm and the anterior abdominal wall. The right lobe can be divided into two other sub-lobes which are the caudate lobe and the quadrate lobe, as they belong morphologically to the right lobe but s","{""links"":[""https://anatomytool.org/content/cenveo-drawing-common-bile-and-pancreatic-duct-english-labels""],""image"":[""https://anatomytool.org/sites/default/files/Unit%209%20D_M4_32.jpg""],""users"":[""elity-sitio""],""tags"":[""stemsocial"",""stem"",""stemgeeks"",""biliary-system"",""bile"",""science"",""hepatic-system""],""description"":"""",""app"":""hiveblog/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2023-01-26 22:51:24,The Anatomy of the Biliary System and Bile Formation,/hive-196387/@elity-sitio/the-anatomy-of-the-biliary,0

@elity-sitio here again. Welcome to another post today, and in today's post I will be sharing on pulmonology which is the branch of medicine that deals with the clinical anatomy, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and conditions affecting the lungs and the respiratory system. In this post, I will be discussing the anatomy of the thorax. In layman's terms, I will be discussing the anatomy of the chest, which is the upper part of the trunk between the neck and the abdomen. Since we are dealing with pulmonology, I will be doing the Anatomy, Histology, Pharmacology, pathology, and the Physiology of the thorax.

In the anatomy of the thorax, I will be taking in two categories which will be the Thoracic wall, made up of bones and muscles, and the soft tissues of the thorax.

Hello and Good day, it is a pleasure to be writing another post to the beautiful post on this community. Before I begin my post today, let me tell you a short story. I was outside with a friend, and we went to the laboratory to get a full test. When I was at the laboratory, I told the attendant that I wanted a full test, and the person beside me said the same thing and then said he didn't ask to be tested for HIV. I was surprised, who goes for a full blood test and omits HIV? He said he didn't want to have a death sentence in writing when he still had a long life to live. He preferred not knowing his HIV status so he can be happy, rather than knowing he is positive and starting to think.

Hi everyone, today I am going to be sharing about Peripheral Arterial Diseases. To begin with, what is peripheral arterial disease? The peripheral arterial disease has to do with the narrowing of the arteries that supply the limbs and the peripheries. These areas include the limbs (legs, and arms) in which the arteries are narrowed and blocked reducing the blood supply to these areas. When this occurs, it usually leads to Claudication (a condition associated with pain or discomfort in the legs while walking as a result of lack of oxygen). The condition in which there is insufficient blood flow to a part of the body is known as Ischaemia, and intermittent claudication occurs in the leg as a result of peripheral arterial disease which usually shows signs during exertion, causing cramp, pain, and ache. The peripheral arterial disease also leads to critical limb ischemia which is a condition where there is a severe blockage or narrowing in the arteries of the limb as a result of lack ","{""links"":[""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis"",""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/atherosclerosis"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4258672/"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2826222/"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1635612/"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5927064/"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430745/"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6113064/"",""https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/PAD.htm"",""https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001005""],""image"":[""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Peripheral_artery_disease.133%2Cjpg.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Peripheral_artery_disease.133,jpg.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemgeeks"",""health"",""stem"",""neoxian"",""ecency"",""curangel"",""pad"",""palnet"",""stemgeek""],""description"":""Hi everyone, today I am going to be sharing about Peripheral Arterial Diseases.

Hearing is a very important ability of humans, and it is the process of detecting and interpreting sound waves to deduce meaningful information. The process of hearing starts with the outer ear, basically the pinna which is the external part of the human ear. The ear is divided into three sections which are the Outer ear, the Middle ear, and the Inner ear. The outer ear goes to the eardrum, the middle ear goes from the eardrum to the oval window and the inner ear includes the Cochlea and the Vestibules, and the ear cells. I am actually not going into the ear in full, today's post is on Eustachian tube dysfunction, but let me quickly explain the process of hearing as fast as possible.

Wonderful things come to mind every day and you just see it as a very big revelation coming through, you see it as something that you need to work on almost immediately because you are sure it isnâ€™t what you should put away at all but once you get up from that position of thought and you decide to share it with those in your circle, they begin to make you see reasons why those dreams are too big and unrealistic, they make you see reasons why you need to choose a little different part act least something that has to do with what majority of people are doing and nothing more.

There is a strong desire by everyone to become successful, the desire for success however by everyone is not backed up with actions to make the desired success accomplished and that is why it is only a little percentage of people who get to hit the mark of success eventually. The road to building a good and successful life has never been easy, it is rough, tough and it requires lots and lots of dedication to get it to work.

We live in a world of social media where everyone is majorly concerned about what other people think about them and this often leads to making decisions that will only help for a short time instead of looking at a way of making long term decisions.  The pursuit of trying to look trendy and classy is a major drive that talks about making very rash and unnecessary decisions, this unhealthy mind set is what makes a lot of young people look really wealthy on social media but are very poor financially.

If we are eager to grow our finance which I believe almost every man on earth is willing to do then we need to be most likely certain of the need to learn about it all the time, as for me topics relating to finance is a thing I always like to learn about and as much as I learn about it, I also like to talk and write about it.

Not all penny stock companies are invaluable, some are undervalued while their company is doing well. The goal of every investor is profit and it is very easy for a penny stock to go up 2000% than a stock with a higher value, this is because penny stocks are very cheap to buy and can rally at a very high percentage compared to stocks of a higher price. Do not forget that all investment comes with risk and penny stocks also have high risks such as fraud and so on.

Did you remember the hyper inflation that occurred in Germany between June 1921 and November 1923 which went up to 30,000%? This was a result of Germany going off the gold standard to fund the war with the hopes that they would win the war but the war went against them and Germany was in deep mess as they were in debt and had to pay off.  Part of the debt was the war treaty but Germany was not allowed to pay its treaty in its currency so it had to start converting all its cash into other currencies. The country was already in debt so the only to solve all its problems, it had to resort into buying other currency with its own currency. This meant printing more currency and using it to purchase other currencies because they were in big need for it. The exchange rate went bad and since they could print more money, they just kept printing the Mark.

Luck isn't a game for the unprepared, it is a game for the prepared mind. You are lucky because you were prepared for an opportunity. The tree you start to plant and water today will be beneficial to you tomorrow.

Investing in employees is one way to improve a company and when this is not done, the company suffers. There are a lot of ways to invest in employees to make them serve the company better, part of them are introducing seminars, provide competitive pay, pay salaries and allowance on time, give room for promotions, increase in pay based on performance and so on.

I decided to write this post because a friend of mine had a child last Thursday, and was looking really confused with basic information like when is the child meant to grow his first tooth, and which set of teeth are going to be the first to show. he also didn't understand a whole lot of things when it comes to human growth and development, so I decided to do the honors to explain in a comprehensive way the human growth and development but in this post, I will be looking at children and toddlers then in subsequent videos, I will explain other stages.

Hey everyone, I hope you are having a good day. I will be discussing in details Burns in humans. Before I start to explain about burns, let me quickly do a run-through on the skin.

The skin is the largest organ of the human body, followed by the liver, and the brain. The skin covers the entire surface of the body and serves as a barrier to protect the internal body from external environmental factors. The skin is made up of three main layers the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue.

Hey, you reading! Welcome to my blog post on StemSocial. Today, I will be discussing **Chiari Malformation** and **Syringomyelia** which in literal terms means ""Cavity in the spinal cord"". It is referred to as an abnormal or pathological neurological condition caused by a fluid-filled cavity within the parenchyma of the spinal cord, or the central canal. Normally, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates through the lateral ventricles which are the first and second ventricle to the third ventricle, then to the cerebral aqueduct then to the fourth ventricle before finding its way down to the central canal. The CSF goes to the foramen magendie and exits to the subarachnoid space.

Hello everyone, @elity-sitio is here again and today we will be discussing Shock, and when I mean shock, I am talking about Cardiovascular shock/ Circulatory shock which is a pathological condition where the cardiovascular system collapses causing widespread hypoxia to several tissues of the body. Cardiovascular shock is fetal and is a clinical emergency. We can say that shock is an acute reduction in tissue perfusion which could lead to an imbalance in supply and demand, lactic acidosis, irreversible organ damage, and also death. Shock basically refers to oxygen demand being higher than the oxygen supply.

When we say stress, our mind naturally goes to the bad side of it. Yesterday, I saw a snake, and I almost collapsed. For minutes I froze at the spot, and was out of my skin. I didn't know what to do, or who to call. This is not the same for some people as they can respond to this type of external factor differently. Some will immediately be alerted to run, others will be alerted to attack and so on. Like my friend whom I told several hours whiles still in the shock of seeing a snake told me that he would have killed it at a blink of an eye. He said he was certain the next thing that would come to his mind was a way to protect himself, and in doing that, he would attack the snake so it doesn't attack him first. Well, we all have different ways at which our flight and fight hormones act to stresses, and let me quickly state that stress can be a good or bad thing. It is a good thing when it functions in the case of adaptation both in our body and to the environment.

Arterial Blood Gases refer to the arterial level of oxygen, carbon, and other gases in the artery confirming if the blood is basic or acidotic. This can be respiratory acid or base or metabolic acid or base, stemming from the lungs or kidney. For instance, if there is excessive carbon dioxide in the lungs the blood will be acidotic or in an acidotic state, and if there is more oxygen and less carbon dioxide, then the blood will be in a basic state. People are always in an acidotic state when sleeping as the breathing level is slower causing the carbon dioxide to be kept more in the lungs, and when they are hyperventilated where the breathing is fast, the person breaths out all the carbon dioxides, leaving the lung to be alkalosis.

Myeloproliferative disorders or you can call it bone marrow proliferation are disorders that are associated with the bone marrow. The Marrow is located in the shaft of long bones such as the femur or the humerus, or in the vertebral bodies, also the bone marrow is responsible for the creation of blood cells in our body from the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells which is a precursor. The bone marrow produces the myeloid stem cells and the lymphoid stem cells. The lymphoid stem cells or lymphocyte makes the B cell, the T cells, and the Natural killer cells. The myeloid stem cells are made up of proerythroblast which become an Erythrocyte (red blood corpuscles), Myeloblast which can divide into three cells which are the Basophils. Eosinophils, Neutrophils, the monoblast which creates the monocyte, and Megakaryoblast which becomes megakaryocytes and these make up the platelets.

Fat! Fat!! fat!!!, I am sure you have heard so many bad comments on this because it is not healthy. Have you tried telling a current champion of SUMO that their fat is bad for them? There is a possibility that you wouldn't be giving the testimony in sound health. Fat makes up most of our body, stored in the largest organ in our body, the skin. In reality, we cannot live without fat, and most people want to lose fat so desperately. A lot of people go to the gym just to burn down the fat that they have even when they are not obese or do not look like people with fat at all. Actually, there are so many things that we do not tell the random person who is not medically inclined. We do not tell them that fat is needed in our life activity, we do not tell them that fat is released with lots of hormones in our body for our bone development, brain development, and in our reproductive organs.

I had a visitor who almost lost his life because of severe stomach pain. He came to visit last week Tuesday and we had dinner together.  At 1:20AM, he came knocking that he had stomach pain and asked if he could get Gbogbonise Epa Ijebu, a herbal remedy that most average-class parents in southwest Nigeria have in their homes. My Mum would always ensure there was a bottle in the house, and whenever I go visit her, she would give me one. It is surprising how you would see this epa ijebu even in the homes of people who are medical practitioners and health workers. Since I have a bottle at home, I decided to give him but then the pain didn't subside, so I was forced to call the security of the area if I could leave at that time of the night as there was a health emergency in my apartment. He agreed and helped me to the hospital. He told other people to keep doing their jobs.

I heard yesterday from an unreliable source that Vaping is better than smoking cigarettes and that it does no harm to the body. I used the word unreliable because it is without no doubt that this person doesn't know anything about vaping except for the fact that he is a user. So I will be looking at vaping and its effect on a person's health.

In clubs and bars, or at home, you might have seen people who take E-cigarettes. This has been branded to be better than cigarettes even when it is not. Before you continue, let me state clearly that the lungs were not created for smoke or anything that will cause them to work with stress. That alone is enough reason not to participate in vaping.

I was seeing a Nollywood movie titled (Tiger's tail) today, and I saw a young child die from cocaine overdose. This got me worried, as a lot of people have been taking cocaine around the world, and it is so surprising how even children about the age of 12 also take cocaine.

While people take a lot of drugs, cocaine is one of the most used drugs in the world. It is no doubt that Coca leaves have been used in South America for a very long time as both stimulant and medicine. While Coca leaf has its own benefit, the cocaine alkaloid in the leaf is what is regarded today as cocaine which is the drug in it. Cocaine is a drug that is frowned at by all law enforcement agencies around the world, so to understand why it is frowned at, we need to understand what cocaine does to the body.

Proteins serve as the foundation of life, as they constitute the essential components of our bodies, animals, microorganisms, and even viruses. They play vital roles in various biological processes such as food digestion, oxygen transport, and DNA replication. In fact, our DNA itself consists of a series of protein instructions. These proteins are composed of 20 different building blocks called amino acids. Some examples of amino acids include Glycine, Leucine, Tyrosine, Glutamine, Aspartic acid, Serine, Asparagine, Glutamic acid, Phenylalanine, and many more.

So let's discuss these parasites but first, what's a parasite? Parasites are cunning organisms that thrive at the expense of others. They take up residence within their hosts, siphoning off nutrients and causing diseases in the process.

I remember discussing that our pets can be responsible for infecting us with parasites, and an example of pets that can do this, is the cat. These graceful creatures can unwittingly transmit parasites like Toxoplasma gondii, an insidious organism that afflicts around 2 million people worldwide. Toxoplasma gondii eggs are commonly found in cat feces, and they can also lurk in undercooked meat.

The nerves in the body are branched out from the spinal cord, and sometimes bundle up with other nerves to form a plexus. Before we continue in a deep dive, it is important that we know what a plexus actually is.

To do this, let's first refresh our memory regarding the nervous system. Our nervous system comprises the central nervous system, which encompasses the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, encompassing all the nerves that branch off from the spinal cord.

While we deal with peripheral nervous system, we always reference the spinal column when dealing with where the nerves comes from. When it comes to movement in the body, the motor nerves get signals from the brain causing the body to move, while for senses, the sensory nerve sends information from the body to the brain.

Embarking on the protein journey, we delve into its necessity, its historical context, and the fine line between sufficiency and excess. Protein, an essential dietary component, is omnipresent in our quest for a healthy lifestyle. Let's unravel the protein saga, exploring its roots, the role of amino acids, and the potential pitfalls when abundance turns into a health hazard.

Th story of looking into proteins started in the 19th century with Vilhjalmur Stefansson sailing to Iceland where he observed that people who lived there fed more on meat and were very healthy but when people in North America switched to eating meat-based diet heavily, they would often become sick as they will experience Nausea and an overwhelming cravings to eat. While both populations consumed meat-based food, the difference was the type of animals they consumed.

You must have heard of Vitamins or maybe you have used some vitamin supplements and you wonder what they truly are. Welcome back to my post, and today we will be discussing Vitamins, why we need them, and how they work from a biochemical point of view.

Before we continue, let's quickly explain what vitamins are. They are small organic molecules, needed by our body in other to carry out regular cellular processes. They are also co-enzymes/co-factors which are used in enzymatic processes. Going back to when they were discovered, they were regarded as vital amines, but this isn't completely true because lots of vitamins aren't even amines. For instance, Vitamin A (Retinol) doesn't have Nitrogen in its structure. So we can refer to them as micro nutrients that are needed by our body to survive.

The words of Jacques Monod, unraveling the genetic control of enzymes and virus synthesis, echo with profound truth: ""All that is true for E.coli, is true for the Elephant.""

While his words might look like that of a person who doesn't have an idea of what is being said, in reality when we look at the molecular composition of both unicellular and multicellular organisms, we share certain things in common, and these things work together to keep us all alive. We share a lot when it comes to our biochemical building blocks that forms our DNA and proteins.

Protein can be obtained from various sources, including eggs, meat, fish, nuts, and supplements. However, there's an exception to the acceptability of protein sourcesâ€”Ricin, a specific protein molecule with potentially lethal consequences, sourced from a seed native to East Africa


It is made up of two protein chains consisting of about 529 amino acids in total and it is sourced from a seed which is native to East Africa.Comprising two protein chains, Ricin toxin A and Ricin toxin B, Ricin becomes toxic only when these chains are bound together. For example, Barley grain contains Ricin's protein A toxin, but lacking protein B toxin makes it safe to consume. Protein B toxin plays a crucial role in Ricin's ability to enter cells and cause damage.

Hair loss, or alopecia, is a common concern for many individuals, and the quest for its causes can often lead us down a maze of conflicting information found on the internet. Various theories have emerged, attributing hair loss to factors like over-washing, stress, excessive testosterone, and more. But what's the truth behind these claims, and which should you take seriously?

Actually, hair loss can start from our teenage age, with about 15 to  25% of men suffering from balding before the age of 20 years, about 1 in 4 men suffer hair loss before the age of 30, and about 30 to 50% of men suffer hair loss before the age of 50 years old. Studies have shown that identical twins who are to lose their hairs with do so at the same age.

In our pursuit to develop insecticides and other agents, we have been able to develop some agents that are deadly or injurious to our health, and this is because they are Nerve agents.

Nerve agents, when dispersed, can be fatal due to their insidious assault on the nervous system. They contain chemical inhibitors that target acetylcholinesterase, a crucial enzyme responsible for regulating acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter with a wide array of functions. Acetylcholine plays a pivotal role in transmitting nerve impulses, stimulating salivary glands, influencing the digestive system by promoting the release of digestive enzymes and enhancing gastrointestinal motility. It also affects respiratory muscles and airway diameter and contributes to blood pressure regulation by influencing blood vessel constriction and dilation.

When people are exposed to nerve agents, they lose function of their pupil, salivary gland, excretion, and ability to breath independently, after which it goes wi","{""image"":[""https://live.staticflickr.com/7243/7106218867_7e8fb38853_b.jpg"",""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Thallium_pieces.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Thallium_pieces.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemng"",""toxin"",""stemgeeks"",""neoxian"",""proofofbrain"",""waivio"",""cent"",""alive"",""ocdb""],""description"":""In our pursuit to develop insecticides and other agents, we have been able to develop some agents that are deadly or injurious to our health, and this is because they are Nerve agents.

Our digestive system is a marvel of biological engineering, and understanding its intricacies can shed light on how our bodies process the food we consume. In this post, we'll embark on a journey through the digestive system, exploring its various organs, functions, and processes.

Our digestive journey commences in the oral cavity, where the process of digestion begins. Teeth play a crucial role in mastication, breaking down food into smaller pieces and this is a vital step in physical digestion. As we chew, saliva moistens the food and transforms it into a soft mass known as bolus. This is where amylase in saliva initiates the digestion of carbohydrates. Within the oral cavity, several glands, including the parotid, sublingual, and submandibular glands, produce saliva. Of these, the submandibular gland is the most prolific in generating saliva, followed by the parotid and sublingual glands.

It is a topic that saturates our news stations, fills the pages of magazines, and serves as the focal point of countless seminars and meetings. Despite our apparent concern, it seems we have been unable to translate this anxiety into meaningful action.

On the surface, climate change might seem like a straightforward issue, talking about greenhouse receiving energy from the sun, and distributing it to the atmosphere, which can lead to changes in climate such are dry regions becoming drier and wet regions becoming wetter. Coastal cities grapple with rising oceans, a stark reminder of the crisis at hand. So, why have we not been able to address climate change effectively, given our advanced capabilities?

There is no global meaning for organic, so it can be defined by different countries depending on the rules placed by the food agencies in the countries but in general, they are food that isn't farmed using Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) seeds, synthetic fertilizers, or synthetic pesticides. Everything in the process of producing the food should be traditional and this includes the use of organic fertilizers and crop rotation. If you decide to buy anything organic in recent times, it tends to be 3 times the amount of non-organic foods that are bei","{""image"":[""https://c.pxhere.com/photos/26/b4/market_fruits_fresh_organic_produce_supermarket_farmers_market_fresh_fruit-828744.jpg!d"",""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50527928312_e456332e41_b.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemng"",""health"",""science"",""stemgeeks"",""neoxian"",""waivio"",""proofofbrain"",""cent"",""alive""],""description"":""I'm guessing you've probably come across the term \""organic food\"" at some point or perhaps you're among those who advocate for its consumption.

If you were posed with the choice between your eyeballs and your eyebrows, many women might lean towards safeguarding their eyeballs, considering that quite a few don't hold a deep attachment to their eyebrows. In fact, some opt to shave them off as part of a fashionable statement. Personally, I find it hard to prioritize one over the other, as I don't engage in eyebrow alterations. This curious trend often leaves me wondering about the motivation behind eyebrow grooming.

Eyebrows, although not as important as the eyeballs which is a major requirement for sight, the eyebrows is entirely not useless. Do you know that it is still possible to identify people in pictures with their eyes blured but it is very difficult to identify them with their eyebrows removed?

I love plants, and if I am going on a vacation, I would like places with trees so I can be able to enjoy nature's beauty but you see, as important as these trees are to us, civilization has led to deforestation which has brought about having little to no trees in cities and industrial areas.

From ancient stone carvings and scrolls to modern books and digital drives, our quest for preserving knowledge has been ongoing. However, one of the oldest and most remarkable storage devices is the human brain itself. Our brains possess the incredible ability to store memories, recognize objects, and process information efficiently. But as we age, we encounter a problem: our memories don't last forever. We experience forgetfulness, and in some cases, even dementia.

Have you ever noticed the mention of Phenylalanine on the cans of soda you drink? It's something that catches the attention of many people, and you might be curious about why it's written on the cans.

Let's delve into the world of Phenylalanine. It's an essential amino acid, a fundamental building block for our bodies. Our body can't produce it on its own, so we need to obtain it from external sources such as meat, fish, poultry, cheese, sesame seeds, lentils, and peanuts. Phenylalanine plays a crucial role in the body's functioning, serving as a precursor for adrenaline and dopamine.

I was down with malaria for a few days and in this period, I started to ask myself when Nigeria will become a malaria-free country? It's not like it is impossible, as it was in so many countries in the past and today, it looks like the country never had malaria before. It is no doubt that malaria is common currently in tropical regions, and humid areas, thriving in regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa, the Mediterranean, and Central and Southern America but how the United States eradicate malaria is one question in my mind, as I am starting to feel like Malaria is now a part of my life.


The malaria parasite which is plasmodium is carried by the female anopheles mosquito that lays its eggs and breeds in still mashy ponds and swamps. When a mosquito bites a person like me a few days ago that has been infected with the parasite, takes in a small amount of blood. The parasite gets into the mosquito and mates. The parasite then begins to reproduce and grow in the mosquito.

Let me start this post by asking a few questions, and I would appreciate it if you give answers to them, either in the comment section or you just respond to them. Do you donate blood? How often do you donate blood? Why do you not donate? and at what point do you feel morally obligated to donate blood to help a person? While these questions can be regarded as ethical, it is up to you to donate blood whenever you feel like it. Blood donation is something that is needed beyond the casual thought of donating, as it would save lives but do you know that not everyone can get blood readily available at the hospital?

In University, I had a friend who was very cautious of his activities, such as tedious sports, handling sharp objects that could lead to injury, and even was always scared to travel, although he still did.

The ear is vital to humans as it is good for both hearing and balancing.It is an important sense and is needed to listen and send hearing information to the brain for interpretation and understanding. In this post, I will be looking into hearing loss and its causes.

The ear is made up of three segments which are the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The outer ear comprises the pinna, the auditory canal, the tympanic membrane, and the Eustachian tube which connects the throat to the middle ear. In the middle ear are the malleus, incus, and stapes which connect the tympanic membrane to the inner ear. The inner ear comprises semicircular canals which are responsible for head movement includes the  vestibular system and the cochlear is responsible for sound vibration to the nerve signal.

Have you laid on your hands overnight, only to see that in the morning, you are unable to move your fifth finger (the pinky finger)? You might feel some tingling or numbness but over time, it would go away. That is just a simple case of your ulnar nerve having a slight pressure against it. This case can be severe in some people causing them to visit the hospital and possibly get surgery, and that case is known as Ulnar neuropathy. So in this post, I will be discussing Ulnar neuropathy.

Ulnar Neuropathy, also known as cubital tunnel syndrome is a mononeuropathy that involves the ulnar nerve. The Ulnar nerve is a nerve found at the upper extremities causing numbness in the pinky region of the hand which also spread to the ring finger.

In the 2000s, Oxycodone which is recognized as Oxycontin was responsible for this death but in recent times, we have been having an increased rate in the use of fentanyl and although these deaths are painful, we could say that misprescription of drugs to patients, the greed of the pharmaceutical companies, malpractice, and illicit production of fentanyl and illegal imports into countries. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fentanyl which is a synthetic opioid is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. It is so powerful that about 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be a fetal dose to a person.

Have you heard of the Carnivore diet? I do not mean Cannibalism, I am talking about a restrictive type of diet that has to do with exclusive meat, fish, and other animal food products like eggs. The carnivore diet has been cited by a lot of people including American orthopedic doctor Shawn Baker has been able to help people lose fat, and help people with depression, anxiety, arthritis, and diabetes. After reading some articles, I want to do a review. I am not going to be saying that the Carnivore diet is bad or it is excessively good, I will be reviewing both. Using a carnivore diet as an elimination diet for leaky gut and gut inflammation is very beneficial to use of a carnivore diet as it eliminates lectin.

Our heart is one organ that works unendingly alongside the brain, to keep us alive. While with a hemispherectomy, a person is possibly going to lose the major function of the part of the brain removed such as losing the ability to see on one side of the body, losing the ability to move on one part of the body, and so on, the person can still move and be alive, but with the heart-stopping work, then the person is dead. While a hospital can still keep people who are brain dead since other organs of their body are still functional, this is not possible when the heart stops pumping blood. This shows how important the heart is and so, a lot of care needs to be placed on the heart. You must have been told that the sugar you take can affect your heart leading to cardiovascular diseases, well that's true.

I was with a lady yesterday, and she was telling me that she didn't know she was pregnant until the fetus was six months old. She indicated that she didn't notice any signs even though they were coming up regularly. I remember a time when one of my aunts got pregnant and she claimed she didn't know until my grandma broke the news to her on a visit. My grandma has a way of knowing a woman is pregnant at first sight and can probably guess how old the pregnancy is. I am not here today to discuss my grandma's supernatural powers of identifying pregnancy, it's not like most grandparents in Nigeria do know how to do that, most of them have that supernatural knowledge or skill to identify pregnancy and pregnant women when they see them. In this post, I will be looking at signs of pregnancy in women, Expected Date of Birth or Expected Due Date.

Hello friends, I welcome you all to my blog and I hope you are having a beautiful day. Today, let's both look at the Thyroid Gland, Hypothyroidism, and Hyperthyroidism, hypoparathyroidism and Hyperparathyroidism. Let's quickly talk about how the thyroid gland secretes its hormones.

This entire step starts in the brain, specifically the hypothalamus. Do not forget at any time that the hypothalamus is responsible for homeostasis. The hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH or thyroliberin) which stimulates the anterior pituitary to release Thyroid Stimulating Hormone. This hormone trigers the thyroid gland to release T3 and T4 thyroid hormones, and Calcitonin. When a person has hypothyroidism, there is low production of the Thyroid T3 and T4 hormones, and when a person has hyperthyroidism, then there is a high amount of Thyroid T3 and T4 hormone. Iodine deficiency is usually a major cause for hypothyroidism, but it can also be caused by autoimune diseases such as H","{""image"":[""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Hypothyroidism_disease.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hypothyroidism_disease.jpg"",""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/3D_Medical_Animation_still_shot_Hyperparathyroidism.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3D_Medical_Animation_still_shot_Hyperparathyroidism.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemng"",""science"",""neoxian"",""biology"",""disease"",""waivio"",""bee"",""proofofbrain"",""stem""],""description"":""Hello friends, I welcome you all to my blog and I hope you are having a beautiful day.

 Hello friends, In my previous post I wrote on Diabetes Mellitus, and I discussed the type 1 and type 2 diabetes where i mentioned that type 1 diabetes is as a result of the Pancreas being destroyed  by the body, thereby causing the person to use insulin life-long, while type 2 diabetes, there are few insulin receptors functioning, this can happen as a result of lifestyle and diet, of it can be genetic. When a patient has type 2 diabetes, the first thing to do is to correct their diet, and lifestyle, including doing exercise, oral medications, and insulin.

Hello friends, today I will be writing on Diabetes 1 and 2.  Let me quickly explain that Diabetes insipidus is a diuretic peeing problem that doesn't have anything to do with Diabetes Mellitus. With diabetes insipidus, there is excessive production of dilute urine and increased thirst as a result of insufficient amounts of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin being produced, which is responsible for regulating fluid balance by controlling how the kidney reabsorbs water which would reduce urine output. One is sugar related, the other is excessive urine and it is amazing how they are both diabetes.

When we eat, the pancreas releases insulin to the blood from the beta cells to reduce the blood sugar level as well as other enzymes that break down the food for energy. To do this, the insulin regulates potassium and sugar in the blood going into the cell, but when there is no food and less energy, the pancreas releases glucagon hormone to break down glycogen in the liver, increasi","{""image"":[""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/3D_medical_animation_still_of_Type_One_Diabetes.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:3D_medical_animation_still_of_Type_One_Diabetes.jpg"",""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Depiction_of_a_home_test_for_diabetes%2C_test_results%2C_and_the_%27big_3%27_symptoms_of_diabetes.png"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Depiction_of_a_home_test_for_diabetes,_test_results,_and_the_%27big_3%27_symptoms_of_diabetes.png""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemng"",""science"",""neoxian"",""stem"",""bee"",""waivio"",""alive"",""cent"",""stemgeeks""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.31-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[1.7777777777777777,0,1.5628815628815629,0]}",2023-03-15 09:23:36,DIABETES - Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 and Type 2,/hive-196387/@elity-sitio/diabetes-diabetes-mellitus-type-1,3

Hello, I was talking to a friend yesterday who started lifting weight some months back. When I saw him, he was really big, I mean like the Johnny Bravo type of big. Out of curiosity, I asked if this was the after effect of weight lifting, and he laughed. I became more interested in the sudden increase in body size and to expectation he said he was also taking steroids. I wasn't surprised because I have heard of so many weight lifters taking steroid, but I didn't expect him to take it since he wasn't a full time weight lifter, and wasn't going to be anytime soon. I seriously do ask myself why weight lifter take steroids even though I understand that they need energy but like my friend, a lot of them do not know the after effect of taking such medications and can stop abruptly which is completely wrong to do, but since they do not know, they might end up with Addisonian crisis.

You must have heard of conditions such as Down syndrome, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). If you have, then these conditions are examples of neurodevelopmental disorders. Quickly, what is a neurodevelopmental disorder?

It is a disorder that affects the brain where there are impairments in the activity of the brain such as learning, memory, controlling motor neurons, and social skills which arises when the brain is still at the developing stage either during pregnancy in the fetus or after the birth of the child. To identify if a child has a neurodevelopmental disorder, the child's developmental milestones can be checked. The milestones are activities that the child is supposed to perform at a certain time, such as sitting up, crawling, Babbling, and talking. If the child doesn't perform all these activities or there is a ","{""links"":[""https://picryl.com"",""https://picryl.com/ru/media/cmdr-john-king-assesses-the-reflexes-of-a-cerebral-palsy-patient-at-the-arima-382952"",""https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/cerebral-palsy/conditioninfo/treatments"",""https://www.physio-pedia.com/Physiotherapy_Treatment_Approaches_for_Individuals_with_Cerebral_Palsy"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7082248/"",""https://www.statpearls.com/ArticleLibrary/viewarticle/19188"",""https://tp.amegroups.com/article/view/35534/28329"",""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.738921/full""],""image"":[""https://cdn14.picryl.com/photo/2008/10/28/cmdr-john-king-assesses-the-reflexes-of-a-cerebral-palsy-patient-at-the-arima-382952-1024.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemng"",""stemgeeks"",""cerebral-palsy"",""cent"",""alive"",""proofofbrain"",""waivio"",""science""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.31-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[{""url"":""https://images.ecency.com/p/2nhMph8Yo3jHc59C4HhoD13FuHs1jZWsi3AHfEDHuFit3SgCvKPiafhRrmGwUD1sCkTtn9k",2023-03-05 19:17:24,Neurodevelopmental Condition and Cerebral Palsy in Infant,/hive-196387/@elity-sitio/neurodevelopmental-condition-and-cerebral-palsy,1

RH blood Grouping and ABO blood grouping. While some people are very used to the Rh- Blood grouping system, it is important to know that the ABO blood grouping system is well recognized and they both work hand in hand. Please do not mistake blood grouping for genotypes, they are not the same in any way. the Rh-blood grouping has to do with antigens and antibodies but before I continue what is the meaning of 'Rh'according to ""The A-B-O blood groups of rhesus monkeys"" shows that it means Rhesus Monkey. This occurred as a result of an experiment where red blood cells from a rhesus monkey were injected into a rabbit and a guinea pig. When this transfusion was done, it was noticed that the guinea pigs developed antibodies that agglutinate the red blood cells from the rhesus monkeys because the red blood cells of the rhesus monkey had antigens that were foreign to the Rabbit system causing the rabbit to produce antisera that fought against the antigen.

I was going to discuss Vitamin K2 before, because I had cheese this morning, and cheese has the highest amount of K2 which is responsible for calcium distribution into the bones and teeth. Vitamin K2 and Vitamin D work hand in hand. While Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium in the intestines into the blood while Vitamin K2 takes the calcium from the blood and transports them into the bones and teeth. That is that on vitamin K2 for now, I will do well to take that topic someday and explain the vitamin properly while explaining its relationship with Vitamin D. So today, I will be discussing the Circulatory system in fish. I decided to change my mind because I was discussing with a friend, and she was mistaking opened circulation for closed circulation, only for her to end up saying that fishes exhibit open circulation.  So I decided to do this very fast, but before then, did you know that the study of fish is called ichthyology?

It is so surprising how much people do not know about health-related topics. I was having a chat with a group of guys today, we were actually discussing weight loss and weight gain. These people are not health professionals, they span from different professions including fashion designers, engineers, sports analysts, podcasters, and two other people who are basic school teachers. While we were having our chat as we often do on Fridays after work,  our discussion diverted toward Eating disorders, and while I was expecting them to say something on the topic even in layman's terms, they asked if there was anything like an eating disorder.

I was shocked, but then I had this thought that most people do not even know about a particular illness, disease, or disorder unless they have to face it firsthand or know who was diagnosed with such.

@elity-sitio is here again, welcome to my blog, and today I will be discussing the Anatomy of the Biliary system. Without any delay, let's get started. The Biliary system is the combination of organs and ducts that produces, store, and transports bile, which is produced by the liver.

The liver is a large reddish-brown meaty organ situated on the right abdominal quadrant of the abdomen, we could say that it is specifically at the right hypochondria abdominal region, although its left lobe can touch the epigastric region. It is divided into two lobes, the right lobe, and the left lobe. The right lobe is the larger part of the liver while the left side is the smaller part of the liver. The lobes are divided by a ligament known as the Falciform ligament which connects the liver to the diaphragm and the anterior abdominal wall. The right lobe can be divided into two other sub-lobes which are the caudate lobe and the quadrate lobe, as they belong morphologically to the right lobe but s","{""links"":[""https://anatomytool.org/content/cenveo-drawing-common-bile-and-pancreatic-duct-english-labels""],""image"":[""https://anatomytool.org/sites/default/files/Unit%209%20D_M4_32.jpg""],""users"":[""elity-sitio""],""tags"":[""stemsocial"",""stem"",""stemgeeks"",""biliary-system"",""bile"",""science"",""hepatic-system""],""description"":"""",""app"":""hiveblog/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2023-01-26 22:51:24,The Anatomy of the Biliary System and Bile Formation,/hive-196387/@elity-sitio/the-anatomy-of-the-biliary,0

Welcome to another post today, and in today's post I will be sharing on pulmonology which is the branch of medicine that deals with the clinical anatomy, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and conditions affecting the lungs and the respiratory system. In this post, I will be discussing the anatomy of the thorax. In layman's terms, I will be discussing the anatomy of the chest, which is the upper part of the trunk between the neck and the abdomen. Since we are dealing with pulmonology, I will be doing the Anatomy, Histology, Pharmacology, pathology, and the Physiology of the thorax.

In the anatomy of the thorax, I will be taking in two categories which will be the Thoracic wall, made up of bones and muscles, and the soft tissues of the thorax.

Hello and Good day, it is a pleasure to be writing another post to the beautiful post on this community. Before I begin my post today, let me tell you a short story. I was outside with a friend, and we went to the laboratory to get a full test. When I was at the laboratory, I told the attendant that I wanted a full test, and the person beside me said the same thing and then said he didn't ask to be tested for HIV. I was surprised, who goes for a full blood test and omits HIV? He said he didn't want to have a death sentence in writing when he still had a long life to live. He preferred not knowing his HIV status so he can be happy, rather than knowing he is positive and starting to think. Let me say clearly that being HIV positive isn't a death sentence, just ensure you speak to your medical counselor and use the retroviral drugs prescribed to you. This said I guess you already have a glimpse of what I will be discussing tonight.

Hi everyone, today I am going to be sharing about Peripheral Arterial Diseases. To begin with, what is peripheral arterial disease? The peripheral arterial disease has to do with the narrowing of the arteries that supply the limbs and the peripheries. These areas include the limbs (legs, and arms) in which the arteries are narrowed and blocked reducing the blood supply to these areas. When this occurs, it usually leads to Claudication (a condition associated with pain or discomfort in the legs while walking as a result of lack of oxygen). The condition in which there is insufficient blood flow to a part of the body is known as Ischaemia, and intermittent claudication occurs in the leg as a result of peripheral arterial disease which usually shows signs during exertion, causing cramp, pain, and ache. The peripheral arterial disease also leads to critical limb ischemia which is a condition where there is a severe blockage or narrowing in the arteries of the limb as a result of lack ","{""links"":[""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis"",""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/atherosclerosis"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4258672/"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2826222/"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1635612/"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5927064/"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430745/"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6113064/"",""https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/PAD.htm"",""https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001005""],""image"":[""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Peripheral_artery_disease.133%2Cjpg.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Peripheral_artery_disease.133,jpg.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemgeeks"",""health"",""stem"",""neoxian"",""ecency"",""curangel"",""pad"",""palnet"",""stemgeek""],""description"":""Hi everyone, today I am going to be sharing about Peripheral Arterial Diseases.

Hearing is a very important ability of humans, and it is the process of detecting and interpreting sound waves to deduce meaningful information. The process of hearing starts with the outer ear, basically the pinna which is the external part of the human ear. The ear is divided into three sections which are the Outer ear, the Middle ear, and the Inner ear. The outer ear goes to the eardrum, the middle ear goes from the eardrum to the oval window and the inner ear includes the Cochlea and the Vestibules, and the ear cells. I am actually not going into the ear in full, today's post is on Eustachian tube dysfunction, but let me quickly explain the process of hearing as fast as possible.

The fact that we do not have control over time is one important reason why we should never joke with it, these were the words I muttered to myself after I opened my hive account this week and realized it has been two long years already. It has been a long unproductive year for my company and after trying so hard to maintain stability some of us had to be relieved of our duties, it seemed like a very bad time for this to happen but, I knew I could not sit and cry for too long, I had to pick up myself and get going before things would get worse.

Our imagination has a very strong power but we are often quick to discard them especially when our group of small minded friends tell us how unachievable it is. 

Wonderful things come to mind every day and you just see it as a very big revelation coming through, you see it as something that you need to work on almost immediately because you are sure it isnâ€™t what you should put away at all but once you get up from that position of thought and you decide to share it with those in your circle, they begin to make you see reasons why those dreams are too big and unrealistic, they make you see reasons why you need to choose a little different part act least something that has to do with what majority of people are doing and nothing more.

There is a strong desire by everyone to become successful, the desire for success however by everyone is not backed up with actions to make the desired success accomplished and that is why it is only a little percentage of people who get to hit the mark of success eventually. The road to building a good and successful life has never been easy, it is rough, tough and it requires lots and lots of dedication to get it to work.

### Penny Stocks
Not all penny stock companies are invaluable, some are undervalued while their company is doing well. The goal of every investor is profit and it is very easy for a penny stock to go up 2000% than a stock with a higher value, this is because penny stocks are very cheap to buy and can rally at a very high percentage compared to stocks of a higher price. Do not forget that all investment comes with risk and penny stocks also have high risks such as fraud and so on.

Did you remember the hyper inflation that occurred in Germany between June 1921 and November 1923 which went up to 30,000%? This was a result of Germany going off the gold standard to fund the war with the hopes that they would win the war but the war went against them and Germany was in deep mess as they were in debt and had to pay off.  Part of the debt was the war treaty but Germany was not allowed to pay its treaty in its currency so it had to start converting all its cash into other currencies. The country was already in debt so the only to solve all its problems, it had to resort into buying other currency with its own currency. This meant printing more currency and using it to purchase other currencies because they were in big need for it. The exchange rate went bad and since they could print more money, they just kept printing the Mark.
