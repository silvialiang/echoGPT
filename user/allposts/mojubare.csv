The truth is, there is a difference between just working and being productive, when you are productive means you are working to get result but at a tired and exhausted state, you may not be able to work to produce any beneficial result any longer.


With lots of blogs telling us about how much sacrifices are to be made by entrepreneurs, some new entrepreneurs just belief they have to kill themselves with work but I will like to remind you that there is a limit to the power of coffee and energy drinks.

Companies like Tesla, Mercedes, Uber are doing their best to get hold of electric cars and make fossil fuel become obsolete but can this be the case?

It is true that there are about 1/10 of cars which runs on electricity, I have been seeing service point and car charging spots in news and documentaries abroad but I haven’t seen any in my country. Countries like China, United States and the Europe have been improving on electric car sales and production in the last 5 years but what about the remaining part of the world? Companies like Tesla, Beijing Electric vehicles, and Nissan are building a lot of electric cars but this cars are promoted to the west and East but not to all part of the world.

I would agree also that some bosses are extremely difficult to work with and such people make it extremely frustrating to have a sound work experience but instead of changing jobs regularly, you can also do some work on yourself and see the way things turn out.

The first and most important key to stay with a boss is trying to connect with your boss, some bosses appear difficult because they are going through so much trying to keep the business in good shape but connecting with your boss will help you understand what the business needs to grow and survive and also what you need to do to grow the business.

There is no perfect age for retirement just as there is also no perfect time for retirement. 

The quote above is an absolutely perfect description for retirement, at a young age when we have the total strength and muscle to work, we have to start preparing for what the age of retirement will look like. Planning is extremely important and a young age is the best time to begin planning for the time when we are going to retire.

As much as we love to maintain a physical body, maintaining a healthy mind as well serves a very great purpose to our lives, the mind that is healthy is a mind that will be able to conceive and achieve better results. As great as it is to keep the mind healthy, it is actually very easy to keep the mind healthy.

The statement got me thinking and I had a deep reflection about how things in my environment are, I figured out that some category of young men were obviously making a lot of money and they were just spending as much as they made as well, then I wondered what will happen if there is a halt to the stream of income they had at the moment it will seriously affect their way of life.

Do you have that classmate who always feel intimidated and withdrawn from every other person, that classmate who often gets bullied by other big boys in the class, I am certain that a lot of people will not want to become friends with someone who is like that, apart from school when such person gets into the social world if that same character is maintained, the person might not be able to mix and relate well with others in the social world or may even have slow growth also.

Success is mostly hindered by the excuses we give not to achieve anything worthwhile, we love to give excuses about the reason why we may not be able to achieve success but the moment we learn to replace those excuses with reasons, we will notice a significant turnaround in our lives. Have something positive that drives you more to make more money, it could be to provide a better life for your family amongst other things but the secret is to have more reasons to drive you to the accomplishment of your dreams.

##### Put in more energy to work.
Now that you have reasons why you want to achieve more success, which is a good thing but being able to put in sufficient amount of energy in order to make that goal become a reality is another thing that needs to be worked upon. The mere reasons/ desire towards success will not bring any significant growth to your income level but the level of dedication that we put in makes a total difference.

What could make the people you employ begin to regard you in a disrespectful way is what we are going to find out in this educating post, I hope you find it educating.

For one, employees may begin to act disrespectfully towards employers because they consider them immature to handle the office and this may not be the fault of the leader but the fault of the employee who is just naturally disrespectful. If the employee will have any reason to stay, the leader must not create grounds where he is going to get disrespected or insulted, he must also not be too strict on the employees but on all grounds he must be firm and take business matters in a highly disciplined way.

Currently, Apple, Amazon, Google and a few more companies like if you say Facebook (although its stock price has been plumating for a while now).

Entrepreneurs are known to be very busy people some of them are so busy that they do not even get the time to take care of their bodies and metal health and when such a person gets into a relationship where attention is required it becomes highly difficult to get things balanced. However, there are certain successful entrepreneurs who have been able to make it to the top and they have equally maintained a great family relationship, how did they managed to do it is something I am very concerned about and if you are as concerned as I am, then you should join me as we continue to unravel the act of being a committed entrepreneur and a good family person.

The need for motivation comes for a person who has been trying to live a different type of life and who has been struggling to get to the height of achievement and the same thing applies to savings, when it comes to savings, it is important to groom ourselves to save more whilst we understand the tricks associated with the ability to save more, bridging the gap and saving more has a lot to do with our ability to motivate ourselves regularly.

In the past, there were several countries which were regarded as poor but in recent times, these countries have grown, and their economy has improved drastically. If you want to have a good example, then let us look at china. In the past, China was a country majorly focusing on agriculture but currently, they it has become a strong economic power.

When it comes to High Net Worth (NTW) classes, the figures matter a lot. The numbers of zeros as well as commas matter a lot and this people instead of handling their finance themselves, get financial banker from banks personally.

It often gets finished before we realize what is going on and when the realize that we have used up all the money we worked for without been able to account for it, sadness fills our heart and we wish we had spent the money in a more appropriate way.

It is usually very easy to spend, there will always be something to buy and with so much attractive advertisement flying all over the place recently, we might just be tempted to get those things we do not want to buy and have regrets about them later on.

Is there really a way to get rid of this spending habit completely and gain full control over our finance again? Yes it is very possible and that is the best way I know that we can use to track our finances and make sure that we do not have regrets after we spend.

This is one concern for investors and people who are interested in buying stocks as the stock market looks overvalued. It looks like the government and companies are just pumping money into the stock market to make it look good. Do not forget that the stock market is what people see when they want to buy stocks in a company, it is what gives a public company its valuation. If the stock price of a company is going down, there is a high possibility that the people would believe that the company is not performing well internally.

The need to satisfy customer requests for fast and highly nutritional food resulted into having robots cook our meals but before we got to the point where robots could cook our food, we had robots that were made in the form of an arm and could easily flip burgers and other robotic machines that could make good salad bowls.

Today I want to share the types of income described by Kiyosaki with you.

Kiyosaki’s analysis says there are four means of income making: employee income, the self-employed income, business owner income and the investor income.

### The Employee income: 
This method of generating income is the most common type of income strategy that we have, this system provides income on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis for workers from employees. This system has been categorized by Kiyosaki as the most risky form of income strategy, the reason for his decision is not far-fetched, he believes in the fact that the employees could get the income earner fired at any time and this means that the said income earner will have no other source of income until the point when he gets another system that wants to hire the skill he has to offer.

It took humans millions of years to create a tool which was eventually created about 1.76 million years ago by Australopithecus who discovered the Oldowan tools which includes hammerstones, stone cores and sharp stone flakes, in short sentence, humans created tools from carving stones. It took almost another 1 million years for humans to discover fire. Fire was a great achievement for humans and was used on a lot of things including foods. The majority of old technological innovations that humans did were dated back to less than 10,000 years which includes the use of iron, wheels, and carriage.

Not every small business owner have their own money and in order to raise a substantial capital for business, some of them go out of their way to borrow money and start businesses. It takes a person who can handle risk to try out something new, to borrow money and know that these ideas will not become a success overnight. It is very necessary to look for ways to minimize risk, as efficient as it is to have the ability to take risk, there should be a limit to the risk taken and the risk should be properly calculated and an intelligent one.

Most local business owners have a constant attitude of nagging about how poor their sales have been and how they are unhappy, but one thing that keeps amazing me is the fact that, no matter how much they complain, they never stop the business, so they complain daily and stick around the business continuously, this makes me ask myself, if this isn’t favorable for them, why don’t they change their line of business or if business is not their thing, why don’t they get employed?

MLM known as Multi-level marketing is a marketing strategy used by companies to get their products sold by non-salaried workers who buy the products with their money and sell the products with the aim climbing a ladder as they get more goods and bring more people in the system.

Starting a new business usually comes with so many risk, you might not even be able to discern the next line of action. However, I have learnt that the act of purchasing a franchise is usually less difficult than building a new business entirely.

Microbiologist Darek Lovley and his colleague at the University of Massachusetts Amherst the microbes were able to produce electrical wires which could be used to generate electricity. They called the electrical wires Microbial nanowires and this research created controversies in the science world for a decade.

My forefather who practice this priest of a thing did not lack anything. There was adequate and surplus food for them from the people. But in our turn the people has become stingy. They refuse to bring thanksgiving offerings to the gods. Do they even think that they were making greatness by their own power and wisdom?

Upon the orientation, I've being passing, trying to stir them to pay thanksgivings to the gods yet all that I said fell on deaf ears. Do they want us to perish to hunger? it has come to a stage that I can't even find meat in my soup anymore. Ijoka the second priest is also complaining of the some thing.

No one dared question the chief priests or accused them of anything because th practice has been revealed from different chief priests from different kingdoms that the festival was from the gods and not the chief priests that manipulated it.

It was said that the festival was a punishment to the kingdom for what their anscestors did against the gods. So king Ukanna offered his daughter as a sacrifice to the gods. aHe doesn't want to bother anyoneor ask his people to provide the virgin girl for the sacrifice.

The chief priest was good to his people and was not in support of that sudden and strange tradition even before his appointment as chief priest. He was the one who gave the king the idea of where he can get solution for his people but he told him that it was not a small task.

The chief priest was not after the riches the gods has given through that practice rather he was concerned with the happiness of the people.

The king was the only person eligible by tradition to embark on such journey. The previously passed chief refused to unveil the measure on which that strange tradition will be abolished because the tradition was for their interest.

This practice lingered until when a brave king emerged from the kingdom. His name was Ukanna. During his reign as king, he arose to seek measures to put an end to the unusual festival they were observing that made the people in the kingdom unhappy.

When the people attempted to violate the festival by foresaking it, calamity will visit the land thereby calling for appeasement of the gods. The practice continued for 10 years until king Ukanna left hie kingdom to seek solution and relief for the people in his kingdom. King Ukanna on his return came back with two bulls from the land of the spirits which he sacrificed as he was commanded and the strange custom  ends. 

King Ukenna was formally a warrior in the land of Ijoko. During the 10 years of king Ukanna's vacation, the throne was empty and nobody was recrowned king.

The kingdom of Ijoko has been a serene place to live. The people of the kingdom had been living in peace, harmony and unity. The people have breathed the breath of relief and comfort for the past 3 century when their ancestors were subjected to a particular festivity which was imposed by their gods.



The festival is meant to be an annual occasion and observed two times in a year, where the entire people gather 30% of their farm produce and offer it to the chief priests as sacrificial items to the gods for two quarters of the year. Soon the chief priests became rich as so many people brought 30% of the chief priests. 

The chief priest became the wealthest people in the kingdom as they were been enriched by the villagers. The people of Ijoko then never worried but after 300 years, the people became fed up of the practice and they started agitating and protesting against it but nothing could be done since they were mandated by their gods to do","{""tags"":[""story"",""fiction"",""nigeria"",""folktales"",""africa""],""image"":[""https://s.hswstatic.com/gif/two-ways-to-count-to-ten-story-1.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmcGTgE9ztQ7QmWESyE7uVqLrUqfbAa1fsTCod6dmsFYjP/GENERIC.gif""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjbz9qs_53YAhXSzaQKHQz7B1YQjRwIBw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howstuffworks.com%2Ftwo-ways-to-count-to-ten-story.htm&psig=AOvVaw1SlvVev37tShV8sr4l-C_v&ust=1514045003800251""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-12-22 16:07:27,The People Of Ijoko; episode 1,/story/@mojubare/the-people-of-ijoko-episode-1,0

For example, discipline comes with patience, one cannot pursue his/her goals in life within the parameters of their faith if they do not possess self-discipline.

You cannot fight against ignorance. To be truthful, no one enjoys discipline. You cannot enjoy being disciplined! NO one enjoys waking up very early to go to work and start a hectic day. Though it is one of the most difficult things to do yet it is one of the profitable and rewarding things to do.

They enjoy their first part of the relationship but then they get to the next face where they start seeing each other's flaws and then they start taking things too personally.

Knowing your right is a different thing, carefully laying it out is another thing. This same thing goes as far as relationships, friendships and so on. So many people might be right and be sincere, in fact, you might offend someone but the manner in which the person will relate the issue might make them wrong.

In other to make a living, stay relevant and have a life of your own, you must be able to give out what you have. Giving what you have to solve problems and meet peoples need is what makes you relevant in the society.

Have you taken time to imagine a world without youth, that means there will be a world without a future because youths are the future. If there is a nation without youth, then there is a nation without a vision, a nation without a drive. Youths are the evidence of a productive past and a prosperous future. A nation without youth will be less active, vibrant and it will be dull.

## Who are youths?
Youths are people not of the same age group and range. They are young adults with strength, the ability to do adventures that lack the experience of matured humans. Youth is said to be the transition stage between childhood and adulthood. Although some people believe that being a youth does not have anything to do with age, rather it has to do with having a heart and mind of continuous progress which is also called hope. It is believed that youths are known to be filled with hope and at that they have a growing mind.
