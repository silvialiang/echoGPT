### WHAT THE RICH DO

Well if you say it is possible then it is possible. So many people believe that it is possible for them to be Rich and they got it. A friend of mine the last time always said to himself I'm going to be in a first class plane just me he drives in the first class plane now.


https://bestonlineuniversities.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Time-Management1-300x300.jpg

Being rich is not a child's play it is not a day's job. Although it requires hard work but you must first start by setting goals. So many people do not know how to set goals they just go around fooling themselves with the mindset that they are still children. They forget that they are responsible for everything they do, everything that happens around them.

Achieving certain things is not a day job. If you want to achieve something in the next ten to twenty years, you write them down as goals. You decide exactly how you intend to get them and what you intend","{""tags"":[""goals"",""achievements"",""nigeria"",""time"",""management""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown"",""community"":""esteem"",""image"":[""https://bestonlineuniversities.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Time-Management1-300x300.jpg"",""https://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2018/01/02/Photos/Processed/hires4-k7KF--621x414@LiveMint.jpg""]}",2018-04-10 21:41:03,Setting goals and managing time,/goals/@ibrahimo/setting-goals-and-managing-time-01a2d65df69b8,2

Oh! Come little one,
Did no one hint you?
The red blonde sunset warn you not? 
Or you act in ignorance,
This thing you pursue,
Greater than your beyond,
Deeper than a casket,
If you must go,
In search of the unknown,
Take precautions from the old man,
Drink concoctions to wade off evil,
For the unknown is brutal,
The untold is heavy,
They say others never came back.

How do you define Right?
Culture Right right?
Conscience Right right?
I have been pondering alot lately,
How do we decide,
When the society already has,
Why do we do things,
Without conscience concert,
We all feeble and follow the norms,
Does norms not change, 
The world revolves,
Yet our mind glued to been scared,
Why do you force me to give openly?
Calling my name out in the open,
I smile because custom demands,
My conscience wants me undercover,
I want to give from the heart,
Same culture interferes in my marriage,
I have never called him 'Sir',
Now he makes big deal out of it,
What happened to the pet name we were fond of?
I have never shown disrespect,
But I love you as 'Darling',
But you insist on your new terms,
I will only call you that because you want it,
I say grudgingly,
Wish it was willingly,
Culture already dictated our role and response,
Even before time,
I only thought we would make a difference,
And follow our new fou","{""tags"":[""poetry"",""poem"",""creativity"",""nigeria"",""writing""],""image"":[""https://img00.deviantart.net/de2a/i/2008/136/a/0/blue_love__by_u_toks.jpg""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwih67qw8vzYAhUHElAKHZGgCjQQjRx6BAgAEAY&url=https%3A%2F%2Fu-toks.deviantart.com%2Fart%2FBlue-love-85730682&psig=AOvVaw3yIwsHcF5PwwAocEUHuBHu&ust=1517305687671744""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-01-29 09:49:39,Our Newly Found Love,/poetry/@ibrahimo/our-newly-found-love,0

Pheromones scent,

Causing me to break another's heart.

The heart of a mother is heavy,
Ready to assign help,
Frustration at its peak.

She never gets appreciated by hobby,
Tender to take blames,
Multiple troubles for her chicks.

Mother never shows worrisome,
The pain in the chest pounds,
Never she tell anyone,
Until she is forced to remain still.

Yet her mind wanders,
Wanting to guide her chicks,
Even in her distress,
She eventually stops when she lost the battle.","{""tags"":[""poetry"",""poem"",""life"",""nigeria"",""writing""],""image"":[""http://www.borderlinepersonalitytreatment.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/BPD-mother.jpg""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjlrN7isvjYAhVCzKQKHW1NAkIQjRx6BAgAEAY&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.borderlinepersonalitytreatment.com%2Fborderline-personality-disorder-mother-book.html&psig=AOvVaw29_eg2ohgH6r904WYIBAor&ust=1517151162306537""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-01-27 14:54:48,The Heart Of A Mother,/poetry/@ibrahimo/the-heart-of-a-mother,1

Oh! Come little one,
Did no one hint you?
The red blonde sunset warn you not? 
Or you act in ignorance,
This thing you pursue,
Greater than your beyond,
Deeper than a casket,
If you must go,
In search of the unknown,
Take precautions from the old man,
Drink concoctions to wade off evil,
For the unknown is brutal,

How can I face my horrors?
Will they one day leave?

I feel you can read my transparency,

Ceiling stare at death,

You crossed my path,
Thoughts worth living for,
I remember your cunning,
The Belle smirk,
Oh! I will miss them,
Tears of regrets fills eyes,
Heart pounding,
Beads of sweat pacing,

How do you define Right?
Culture Right right?
Conscience Right right?
I have been pondering alot lately,
How do we decide,
When the society already has,
Why do we do things,
Without conscience concert,
We all feeble and follow the norms,
Does norms not change, 
The world revolves,
Yet our mind glued to been scared,
Why do you force me to give openly?
Calling my name out in the open,
I smile because custom demands,
My conscience wants me undercover,
I want to give from the heart,
Same culture interferes in my marriage,
I have never called him 'Sir',
Now he makes big deal out of it,
What happened to the pet name we were fond of?
I have never shown disrespect,
But I love you as 'Darling',
But you insist on your new terms,
I will only call you that because you want it,
I say grudgingly,
Wish it was willingly,
Culture already dictated our role and response,
Even before time,
I only thought we would make a difference,
And follow our new fou","{""tags"":[""poetry"",""poem"",""creativity"",""nigeria"",""writing""],""image"":[""https://img00.deviantart.net/de2a/i/2008/136/a/0/blue_love__by_u_toks.jpg""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwih67qw8vzYAhUHElAKHZGgCjQQjRx6BAgAEAY&url=https%3A%2F%2Fu-toks.deviantart.com%2Fart%2FBlue-love-85730682&psig=AOvVaw3yIwsHcF5PwwAocEUHuBHu&ust=1517305687671744""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-01-29 09:49:39,Our Newly Found Love,/poetry/@ibrahimo/our-newly-found-love,0

Pheromones scent,

Causing me to break another's heart.

Attempts to make you speaks,
Instead she smiles and laugh,
Not uttering a sound,
If you be dumb,
I will take for love.

Persuasion to go swimming,
You nod to decline,
I plead for hangout,
Diving into the water,
You gulp for air,
I fear for my love.

A drenched smell like a corp,
Sympathizers surrounds,
I draw near to massage,

The heart of a mother is heavy,
Ready to assign help,
Frustration at its peak.

She never gets appreciated by hobby,
Tender to take blames,
Multiple troubles for her chicks.

Mother never shows worrisome,
The pain in the chest pounds,
Never she tell anyone,
Until she is forced to remain still.

Yet her mind wanders,
Wanting to guide her chicks,
Even in her distress,
She eventually stops when she lost the battle.","{""tags"":[""poetry"",""poem"",""life"",""nigeria"",""writing""],""image"":[""http://www.borderlinepersonalitytreatment.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/BPD-mother.jpg""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjlrN7isvjYAhVCzKQKHW1NAkIQjRx6BAgAEAY&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.borderlinepersonalitytreatment.com%2Fborderline-personality-disorder-mother-book.html&psig=AOvVaw29_eg2ohgH6r904WYIBAor&ust=1517151162306537""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-01-27 14:54:48,The Heart Of A Mother,/poetry/@ibrahimo/the-heart-of-a-mother,1

### WHAT THE RICH DO

Well if you say it is possible then it is possible. So many people believe that it is possible for them to be Rich and they got it. A friend of mine the last time always said to himself I'm going to be in a first class plane just me he drives in the first class plane now.


https://bestonlineuniversities.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Time-Management1-300x300.jpg

Being rich is not a child's play it is not a day's job. Although it requires hard work but you must first start by setting goals. So many people do not know how to set goals they just go around fooling themselves with the mindset that they are still children. They forget that they are responsible for everything they do, everything that happens around them.

Achieving certain things is not a day job. If you want to achieve something in the next ten to twenty years, you write them down as goals. You decide exactly how you intend to get them and what you intend","{""tags"":[""goals"",""achievements"",""nigeria"",""time"",""management""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown"",""community"":""esteem"",""image"":[""https://bestonlineuniversities.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Time-Management1-300x300.jpg"",""https://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2018/01/02/Photos/Processed/hires4-k7KF--621x414@LiveMint.jpg""]}",2018-04-10 21:41:03,Setting goals and managing time,/goals/@ibrahimo/setting-goals-and-managing-time-01a2d65df69b8,2
