Whenever people are communicating with you, they want to be sure that they are been listened to, snubbing them is making them feel very irrelevant and of course you do not expect them to like you if they do not feel valued. 
Try to listen more to the people who want to talk to you, when a customer is trying to give a report about your product or trying to tell you what they want, ensure that you are paying rapt attention and you are listening well.

Most often when we see a sick person who has to go through medical treatment, we feel either pity or sorry for them even without staying with them for a very long time, imagine the state of mind of those who need to stay with/take care of a loved one who is going through a severe medical condition. Often mistaken for burnout, is the case of **Compassion Fatigue**, which is a term used to describe the emotional, physical, and psychological impact of having to help other sick people, in a nutshell, compassion fatigue is a cumulative sense of dissatisfaction or fatigue.

The feeling of burnout could be a form of fatigue, but speaking about compassion fatigue, completely encompasses a more specific environment that is contributed due to a stressful environment or workplace. If we want to get more specific, we will bring it down to medical professionals like; nurses, first responders, therapists, doctors, or other professionals that need to provide adequate healthcare services.

Hello friends, it's beautiful to have my article published in this amazing community and the topic I will be writing about today is, **Chagas disease**, I hope you enjoy reading just like the previous one, I actually believe that this topic is a very interesting one and you will agree with me after reading that it is.

Speaking about Chagas disease, it is significant that we understand that it is a tropical parasitic infection, transmitted through crawling hosts like blood-sucking insects like kissing bugs. Chagas disease is also called **American trypanosomiasis**, the disease could be described as a regional one because the kissing bug is almost exclusive to central Latin America. The infection from the bite is from the parasite *Trypanosoma cruzi*(T.cruzi). The most common means of transmitting the disease is through a bite from an infected triatomine bug (kissing bug), but asides from the transmission through a bite, there are other methods of transmission that although may be","{""links"":[""https://www.flickr.com/photos/marcygallery/3803517719"",""https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/chagas-disease"",""https://medlineplus.gov/chagasdisease.html"",""https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/infectious-diseases/extraintestinal-protozoa/chagas-disease"",""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-"",""https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/index.html"",""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356212"",""https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21876-chagas-disease"",""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagas_disease""],""image"":[""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Triatoma_dimidiata-adult.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Triatoma_dimidiata-adult.jpg"",""https://images.ecency.com/DQmSjcETVuo5zXaF23QA9D72gVVhmF4B1sGdHomnmra2mrV/image.png""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""disease"",""infection"",""health"",""ocd"",""neoxian"",""steemgeeks"",""science"",""nigeria"",""africa""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.30-vi",2023-01-05 20:07:03,"Chagas disease,a disease spread through kissing bug.",/hive-196387/@busted1/chagas-disease-a-disease-spread,4

Naturally, humans are drawn to sweet things, whenever we want to eat anything, we definitely want an item that is appealing to our taste bud. While the mouth wants those sugary contents, the question is, how healthy is it for our body? A lot more people are now so concerned about their health more than before, so we have people limiting their level of sugar intake these days for the sake of their health which I believe is a wise decision, on the other hand, we also have people who will not give up on their massive love for sugar, not for anything and it is for friends like that, I make this post today, thank you for visiting my blog and please join me as we go through the path of knowledge gain together.

I grew up seeing my sister go through intense pain whenever it was that time of the month, she would literally roll and cry and my Dad would put her head on his lap while he pats her back, and oh because I love my sister so much I would cry alongside sometimes, I always wonder why anyone would have to go through such pain just because they are having their monthly cycle. As she got older, the pain reduced and she started to get better. I don't know what happened again, but lately, she complained about the symptoms coming right back, but I don't cry alongside her anymore, the last time I visited her carried her on my back to make her feel better(lol), my sister can be a baby during that time of the month, and I love her so much, as a matter of fact, I wish I could be with her at those periods of the month, but it is not possible.

#### <center>Introduction</center>

One very popular topic amongst women when discussing health is Breast Cancer. A lot of women visit the hospital at a very late period only to find out that they have had this long and didn't know. Today, I will be discussing Breast Pathology which deals with abnormalities in the tissues of the breast. Breast Pathology can be in three forms, Breast Inflammatory condition, Breast Benign condition, and Breast Magninant Condition. The inflammatory conditions include Mastitis, Mammary Duct Ectasia, and Fat Necrosis. Benign conditions include Fibrocystic changes, Intraductal papilloma, Fibroadenoma, and Phyllodes tumor. The malignant condition classes are Ductal Carcinoma in Situ, Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Lobular Carcinoma in Situ, and Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. I will be picking them one after the other, so join me as I continue in this post.

On today's episode of learning more about sexually transmitted infections, I will be writing about **Genital Herpes**. I took a special interest in studying and writing about sexually transmitted infections because, so many people believe that once they have tested negative for HIV/AIDS virus then there is nothing to fear, but there is a lot to fear and one of them is Genital Herpes.

**Genital Herpes** is a sexually transmitted infection that causes herpetic sores, the sores are painful blisters that can break open and then ooze out a fluid. Two types of herpes simplex virus (HSV) cause genital herpes;
* HSV-1: This virus basically causes cold sores, but it can also cause genital herpes.
*HSV-2: This virus causes genital herpes, but can also contribute to causing cold sores.

After taking the long walk to my polling center in order to cast my vote for the presidential candidate of my choice, I have taken a few days to observe the process of result collection and awaiting the announcement of our new president, but it seems like we are not going to head anywhere with that anytime soon, today alone the announcement of the result from other states have been postponed four(4) times already and everyone is basically tired of what is going on over there.

My sister who happens to be a classroom teacher was telling me about a little boy in her class who has autism, in Nigeria, so many children who should be placed in a unique space are often joined with other children, and the parents will always give the excuse of wanting them to mix up with other kids, but I am always of the opinion that children with special needs should be trained by teachers who have the skill to do that, mixing them up with other children is a NO for me, but that is entirely my opinion though. So, back to what I was speaking about, the child having autism was not a new story as I have read and watched videos of children with autism, but what got me scared was the fact that she mentioned that the child actually inflicts injury himself, he may begin to scratch his face angrily, cause severe damage on his body while screaming.

Yesterday, I went out with a friend to have a drink, and while we were outside I decided to open my coca-cola drink the Nigerian way. Ohh! In case you do not know, the Nigerian way I mean is using your teeth to open the cork of the bottle. Immediately I placed my teeth on the bottle, my lower canine tooth broke a little. I was very down all through the day because I a part of my tooth was gone, and I vowed never to use my teeth again. I am not discussing the teeth today, I am actually discussing the bone but I want to state that the bone isn't metal just as the teeth aren't metal. Also, since they both contain calcium, I felt I should be able to share their similarities and warn that the teeth can be very fragile, and Calcium is not titanium.

Sweet friends, it is with great honor that I write this post today, I have been reading about it for some time and I will gladly be sharing what I have learned about it with you today. I have been writing about *staphylococcus aureus infection*. Staph infections are caused by staphylococcus bacteria, the germs are usually found on the skin or in the nose of so many healthy individuals, in most cases, the bacteria would not cause any major problem or in a few cases, cause a relatively minor skin infection. Staphylococcus infection can, however, become deadly when the bacteria invade deeper into the body, getting into the bloodstream, bones, joints, heart, or lungs, on a constant basis healthy people are developing the life-threatening phase of staph infections.

Hello everyone, it's good to be here today. Thanks to everyone who reads my post, and leaves a comment, and most especially those who reply to my comments on their posts, it means a lot to me as an individual. Today, we will be doing a little bit of plant science, looking at Photosynthesis. A lot of people who are in medical school, or have to do with animal science, find plant science a little boring, even when it is very interesting. Well, without wasting any time, let me quickly discuss photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis can occur in two phases, light-dependent and light-independent reactions. As the name implies, light-dependent photosynthetic reaction converts light energy into chemical energy where it absorbs photons and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) to release Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and Energy (NADPH/ATP) in the Thylakoid membrane where it involves photoexcitation (photon excite electrons) where a photon brings an electron to a high energy state which is harnessed (the energy) by an ","{""image"":[""https://live.staticflickr.com/4022/4619809768_0515d645d0_c.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stem"",""stemng"",""stemgeeks"",""neoxian"",""waivio"",""photosynthesis"",""cent"",""vyd"",""bee""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.31-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[1.7543859649122806]}",2023-03-16 17:35:39,Photosynthesis - Light Dependent and Light Independent Reaction,/hive-196387/@busted1/photosynthesis-light-dependent-and-light,2

Whooping cough is a very contagious respiratory tract infection, it is a bacterial bacteria that can find its way into the nose and the throat. It can affect people of any age but is more deadly for infants and young children. Right before the development of the vaccine, the whopping cough was initially considered a childhood disease, but now, whopping cough primarily targets children who are too young to have completed the full course of their vaccination, and also teenagers and adults who have had their immunity faded. Death cases associated with whooping cough are not so common, but happen more with infants when it happens, the more reason why it is more than necessary ","{""image"":[""https://images.pexels.com/photos/4153315/pexels-photo-4153315.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1"",""https://images.pexels.com/photos/6865171/pexels-photo-6865171.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""science"",""health"",""infection"",""neoxian"",""ocd"",""stemng"",""cough"",""proofofbrain"",""cent""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.31-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666]}",2023-04-08 09:14:54,How Whopping Cough Terribly Affects Children and Teenagers.,/hive-196387/@busted1/how-whopping-cough-terribly-affects,1

In my country, there are two major illnesses that affect almost every household, one of which is malaria, which I wrote about in my previous post, and the other is typhoid, which is really a serious case over here and believe me when I say this condition has affected so many people. Typhoid fever is an infection caused by the bacterium *Salmonella Typhi*, typhoid is usually spread through contaminated water or food. Once there is an injection of *Salmonella Typhi* bacteria, they multiply and spread into the bloodstream.

When I wrote about typhoid sometime back, it brought to my mind quickly that, the water problem in so many rural regions particularly in underdeveloped countries causes so many problems asides from typhoid, amongst the problem caused is Cholera and that is the reason why I will be writing on Cholera today.
Cholera is a serious diarrhea illness that is caused by an intestinal infection with the toxigenic bacterium Vibrio cholera. Cholera is a public health disease associated with high morbidity and mortality, before we go on with the deep-rooted issues of cholera, I will like to take you through some of the history.

There was a disease that was thought to be cholera, and it was found back in Sanskrit in the 5th century BC, the disease had existed in the Indian subcontinent for centuries. In 1817, cholera begins to spread beyond the Indian subcontinent and then came six worldwide cholera pandemics that lasted between 1817-1923.

Rubella is an ancient disease whose existence dates back to the 1700s, at that time, the clinical manifestations of the disease were described by two Physicians who were German, de Bergan(1752) and Orlow (1758). As at that time, it was considered to be one of the derivatives of measles, accompanied by the strong German influence, the name German measles became widely acceptable.
Rubella is gotten from the Latin word which means little red, it is caused by the rubella virus, which belongs to a member of the Rubivirus genus family. Rubella is a mild viral disease that affects mostly children and adults whose immune system is not strong. When rubella affects pregnant women, it can produce several birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome.

The first time I heard about, Hand-foot-and-mouth disease, I concluded that it was going to be a type of disease that affects just the hand, foot, and mouth, which is right for any layperson to describe considering the name, but once again, science and medicine have proven to be smarter and to let us know that, things are actually deeper than the name they bear. 

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is a viral illness that presents itself as a vesicular eruption in the mouth, but it does not only affect the mouth as it has the possibility of also involving the feet, buttocks, hands, and genitalia. It is a highly infectious disease caused by the virus *Enterovirus genus*, most commonly known as, *coxsackievirus*. It can affect any age bracket but is more common amongst children who are below 5 years of age, it can spread from one person to another through unwashed hands or from surfaces that are contaminated with feces, saliva, or respiratory secretions.

HIV is a serious virus that affects the immune system, it increases the risk involved and seriously impacts other infections and diseases, when HIV is not adequately treated, it progresses to the 3rd stage that we know as AIDS. Some health agencies including the World Health Organization WHO, have observed and reported that so many people living with HIV still live long and healthy lives just like those who have tested negative for the virus, but this is only possible when the individual takes antiretroviral drugs as prescribed by the doctor.

I would have loved to do the comparison between electric stoves and gas stoves but I would rather let us talk about the health impact of gas stoves since we are all conversant with it.

The reason for picking a gas stove is simple, most households in the US and the UK use gas, Most average-living Nigerian use gas, although we know that a lot of Nigerians live below the average and still use coal, and kerosene which I would touch later, but for now, let's do gas stoves. Do you know that having a gas stove in your house is hazardous to you even after eliminating the explosion factor?

In this post, I will be discussing Cesarean Section, and why a woman could undergo the procedure.

A Cesarean section involves making an incision in the mother's abdomen to safely deliver the baby. This method is chosen when the healthcare provider determines it to be a safer option for the mother, the baby, or both, compared to vaginal birth. Some women opt for a C-section by choice, known as elective surgery, scheduled around the 39th week of pregnancy. Additionally, women who have previously delivered via C-section are often advised to choose this met","{""image"":[""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Blausen_0223_CesareanDelivery.png"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blausen_0223_CesareanDelivery.png"",""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/First_Breath.jpg/1200px-First_Breath.jpg?20171112232310"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:First_Breath.jpg"",""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/%E5%89%96%E8%85%B9%E4%BA%A7%E5%88%80%E7%96%A4.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%E5%89%96%E8%85%B9%E4%BA%A7%E5%88%80%E7%96%A4.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemng"",""stemgeeks"",""neoxian"",""ocdb"",""waivio"",""cent"",""alive"",""bee"",""proofofbrain""],""description"":""Giving birth is one beautiful experience, but in Nigeria, the way women see Cesarean section is as though anyone who has it, was unlucky.

In the words of my friend, ""Pimples always seem to make an appearance at the most inconvenient times in life – like your birthday, your first day at work, or even your wedding day."" We've all experienced that moment when a pimple pops up, causing discomfort and frustration. But have you ever wondered why pimples occur and how to get rid of them?

Our skin is made up of hair follicles which we also refer to as pore, and within the follicle is the Sebaceous gland that produces oily substances known as Sebum to the skin keeping the hair and body moiturized. When the hair follicle get clogged with dead skin cells and oils, a blockage is created to the Sebum which is still being created but trapped within the follicle making it become enlarged leading to Acne.

Yesterday, I found myself entertaining a whimsical notion – the idea of being struck by a seemingly ordinary object, like a ball, and miraculously gaining extraordinary abilities akin to Kyle from the movie Kyle XY. However, in the midst of this fanciful daydream, I recalled a fascinating reality: there exists a genuine condition where individuals who previously lacked certain skills suddenly acquire remarkable talents in specific areas of their lives, even including enhanced intelligence. This intriguing phenomenon is known as Savant Syndrome, and it is the subject of today's discussion.

The concept of libido, which encompasses one's sexual desire, drive, and overall interest in sexual activity, is a term that's widely recognized. In this discussion, however, we'll set aside the explicit connotations often associated with it and delve into the scientific aspects that underpin our understanding of sexual desire.

Libido can vary significantly from one person to another, and it is important to know that having a lower desire for sex isn't inherently abnormal but this can be influenced by various factors which can be Biological, psychological and social reason. Cases of low level of testosterone and estrogen can decrease the desire for sexual desires.

Understanding Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) is crucial for anyone who is sexually active, whether through personal experiences, knowledge gained from others, or educational resources. Unfortunately, there are still widespread misconceptions and a lack of awareness surrounding STIs.

Many people remain unaware of how STIs are transmitted and treated, and some hold misconceptions that perpetuate stigma. For instance, the misconception that STIs are solely associated with poor hygiene is far from accurate. While engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners without practicing safe sex measures can increase the risk of STIs, these infections are caused by pathogens like chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, hepatitis B, HPV, HIV, syphilis, Trichomoniasis, among others. These pathogens don't discriminate based on hygiene; they can infect anyone.

Since there was no wound or trauma to the head, she went to the hospital and had a CT scan which showed that she had experienced blood clotting and swelling in her brain. 

Blood clots, also known as thrombi, are gelatinous masses that can form within our blood vessels. These clots may remain intact or become dislodged, and they can emerge anywhere in the body.

But, moving away from childhood memories about appendicitis, let's talk about some of the science-proven facts about it. Appendicitis happens when the appendix gets clogged, infected, and gets inflamed.

If you always check the news, you will agree with me that one thing is true that fire is ravaging the world's rainforest  including the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest. Most time, these fire are man made fire that were intended to clear the land for agriculture but then the fire spread uncontrollably.

While the G7 and other government bodies have contributed millions of dollars to stop this fire, it doesn't look like the Brazilian government is doing much to stop deforestation and this has caused lots of support to stop. Across different continents, the world's rainforest is gradually vanishing and if nothing is done about it, it will become a thing of a past in maybe about 100 years.

While we have been able to do a lot of things, one thing we still battle is longevity, and death. The fact that we will all die and not have our consciousness is a big concern for us humans, and we continually look for how to extend our life expectancy, or even reach immortality.

It isn't like it started today. The quest for longevity and immortality has been since about 210BCE where China's emperor Qin Shinhuang ordered that an Elixir of immortality be gotten to him. In the 3rd Century AD, Alchemist created a philosopher Stone that could restore youth as well as grant immortality. Another one is the some worth mythological Exploration of Juan Ponce De Leon in 1513, to search for the fountain of youth.

The type of snoring I am talking about is not a silent one, but the type that kept me awake all night, been so disturbed about it, that I had to speak to his Mum immediately about it to have him checked medically, but aside from that, I was also interested in knowing what was making my little friend snore so loudly.

I planted chili some weeks back and they are doing fine but then, I forgot to water them yesterday and since we are have a dry weather in Nigeria here, the leaves started to wither. When I saw this, I immediately watered the pot where the plants were grown, and in few hours the leaves were back to normal like nothing happened.

The incident with my chili plants got me thinking about the broader impact of climate change on our lives, even extending to our dinner tables. The dry weather is affecting crucial crops like maize/corn, wheat, rice, and barley, raising concerns about food security. While scientists are exploring genetically modified plants as a solution, there's another avenue to address this challenge: soil microbes.

You must have seen a lot of people who are blind, and when you ask if they were born blind, you get responses like they never saw anything since they knew themselves. Such cases can exist in lot of children who when giving birth to looked like they have good sight, only to see that they begin to develop symptoms such as eyes moving involuntarily and not being able to gaze at people. This type of symptom can be associated with conditions such as Leber Congenital Amaurosis which is a congenital disease.

Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is a condition caused by genetic changes or mutations which causes visual impairment and could lead to people getting permanently blind from childhood. It is very unfortunate to say that just like LCA, there are lots of disorders that cannot be cured but then some scientists have been working to change this, so people can be able to see again.

If she eats so much, it is believed the mother is eating for herself and her child, but what channel does the food pass through? That question has been bothering me lately, so let's get to it.

While growing up, I noticed that parents would usually cut a tiny thread from a cloth and place it on the baby's head during an episode of hiccups. For me, I always wondered why, and I remembered that a few times I did the same thing to myself whenever I had an episode of hiccup.

Did it work for me? I cannot even say exactly, because I cannot tell if it did or not, but it appears to work for those little children though. Describing the connection between a piece of thread being laid gently on a baby's head and the creation of a stop to a hiccup episode is one thing I cannot explain, but it does happen (smiles). Taking water has however proved to be the best remedy in my own case.

The opinions are as diverse as they come, with some believing it can lead to a longer life, while others argue it might be a shortcut to an early grave. Then, there are those who stand somewhere in between, unsure of which side to support. In this post, we delve into the controversial Keto diet and separate scientific facts from anecdotal claims.

Keto diets are very low carbohydrate diets, and as we know that about 75% of out body calories come from fat, 20% from protein and about 5% to 10% from carbohydrates. While this is known, we cannot deny the fact that keto diets have been praised online by a lot of people for helping in weight loss, diabetes management, improvement of heart health, and although unproven, for some weird reason, some people believes it can fight cancer.

Fast forward to today, and nearly 80% of the global population has internet access through their mobile devices. It's a technological leap that has revolutionized how we interact with the world, but it's not without its consequences.

In the present day, smartphones have become extensions of ourselves.

Ozempic has become a household name for various reasons, and its widespread popularity has taken my country by storm. If you're curious about the extent of a drug's popularity, you needn't look any further than the presence of counterfeits in stores. Notably, the Food and Drug Agency in my country has raised concerns about a particular batch of this brand, suspecting it to be counterfeit.

From Celebrities to Influencers, Presenters, and even in the news, Ozempic is everywhere and it is surprising that its main function is to treat Type-2 Diabetes. It is the brand name for the drug Semaglutide which helps to regulate blood sugar levels by imitating the Hormone Glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) that is produced in the gut. Why the popularity of the drug with everyone since not everyone is suffering from Type-2 Diabetes?

Did you know that the delicious burgers you have in your hand will become nutrients as well as waste products? To be candid, there are also foods that we eat that are more of waste and less of nutrients. By digesting food, the body breaks it into different types of nutrients and waste products. We will be looking at the waste part of it in the post, and not the nutrient part of it.

As undigested remnants of food make their way from the stomach to the colon, they undergo a transformation into what we recognize as feces. This metamorphosis is made possible through the rhythmic contractions of the intestinal walls, which extract water from the waste materials. Additionally, a community of bacteria plays a crucial role in the final stages of digestion. These bacteria aid in breaking down complex food molecules, releasing methane and ammonia gases, notorious for their pungent and disagreeable odor, which can enhance the scent of the departing waste which is the feces.

Have you ever wondered what happens when your meal takes a wrong turn inside your body? Before you start pondering which way is truly ""wrong,"" remember that there are essentially two routes your food can take – it's either on the path to digestion or the road less traveled. So, let's dive into how food sometimes ventures into the wrong tube and the consequences that follow.

The journey begins at the oral cavity or the mouth which is made up of the tongue, and the palates (hard and soft palate) which separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity. When food gets into the mouth, the tongue will help to mix and move the food toward the esophagus where there is also the pharynx. The pharynx includes the upper pharynx (nasopharynx), the oral pharynx, and the laryngopharynx.

I read a funny survey about how several people were asked about piles and they expressed their fears concerning it, but at the mention of hemorrhoids, they didn't feel really scared about it. I said it was funny because it means the same thing. So, if you have been scared about piles, you may want to start getting scared about hemorrhoids too, or maybe you do not even have to be scared also.

Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the lower part of the anus and the rectum. When the walls of the vessel get stretched, they could also get irritated, the development can happen for several reasons, including pregnancy, constipation, and age.

The appendix has long been viewed as a seemingly superfluous organ in our bodies. In fact, when someone experiences unexplained abdominal pain, surgeons often err on the side of caution and remove the appendix to prevent the potentially life-threatening condition known as appendicitis. So, it begs the question: Is the appendix truly useless, or does it serve a purpose that we're only beginning to understand?

While the appendix has historically been labeled as functionless, a shift is occurring in the scientific and medical communities. Recent discoveries and evidence have prompted a reevaluation of the appendix's role in our bodies. Some researchers are now suggesting that this seemingly enigmatic organ plays a significant part in our immune system, while others have posited more intriguing theories

Have you ever been instructed to abstain from eating or drinking before a medical procedure, particularly if anesthesia is involved? This practice is rooted in essential safety measures that ensure your well-being during any medical intervention, especially those requiring anesthesia.

Personally, I've adhered to this guideline, even for procedures with a short duration of less than 10 hours. It's a precautionary approach, considering the potential need for emergency operations that involve anesthesia. The medical community strictly prohibits eating or drinking prior to any anesthesia-related procedure, and even the smallest consumption, like a candy-sized snack, can result in a procedure postponement to ensure your safety.

Let's discuss hearing and delve into a few hearing conditions but first, let me give ask a question? Do you think it is possible for a person who had a good hearing problem before going to bed to wake up the following day with difficulty hearing the voices of males but hear the voices of females properly? Or what would you say about a person who can hear very faint sounds, as low as an ant walking in the next block, or the dog whistle but would not hear loud sounds in close proximity?

These puzzling scenarios are indeed possible, and they are attributed to a hearing condition known as Reverse-Slope Hearing Loss (RSHL). It's a condition where the ability to hear low-frequency sounds is compromised, leading to heightened sensitivity to high-pitched sounds. To comprehend this phenomenon, let's first grasp the mechanics of hearing.

In recent times, there has been a growing trend of people, including younger men and athletes, turning to testosterone supplementation for various reasons. I remember back then in school, some boy wanted to have beards compulsary and would put methylated spirit on their chin. Till date, I still wonder where that theory came from, but trust me, it is false. If it were true, then we should all have beards on our body by now, because we all use rubbing spirit on wounds, or even before injections. We would touch beards and hair along the line, as we discuss testosterone.

Testosterone, a hormone in the body, plays a vital role in numerous physiological functions, including the development of masculine characteristics, maintenance of bone density, muscle strength, and sex drive. However, it is crucial to understand the complexities of testosterone supplementation, the reasons behind its usage, and the potential risks involved.

While she was pregnant, he found every reason to throw her punches from time to time, On the day she found out her water broke, she asked him to take her to the hospital, and like someone who is possessed, he decided to give her some good beating again.

One of my female friends got into a long-distance relationship with a young guy, and after some time of dating, they decided to spend some physical time together she was so excited about the experience, and she went to meet him, only for her to come back after a week and she insisted that was the end of the relationship, and nothing could ever bring them back together.

I was confused at first because she was so happy and filled with smiles when she set out on this journey, so coming back with this attitude was rather surprising and confusing, when she was calm enough to explain her ordeal, she mentioned that this boyfriend of hers did not have a bathe all through the one week she spent with him. On the day she arrived, she didn't see it as a big deal because not everyone was going to be like her, who bathes twice daily, but even on the third day, she didn't see any sign of him having his bath.

In a random Nigeria home, when you mention that your nose is picking up a funny smell as a lady, the first suspicion is pregnancy, but what about the male gender? They just ignore us most times, since we cannot get pregnant and disappoint them (as most parents claim). Pregnancy is a very good thing, please do not get me wrong, but getting pregnant out of wedlock in a typical Nigerian home is a taboo, and parents will do all they can to fight it, except of course, they are left with no other choice.

You know what they say about stomach pain and how highly inconvenient it could become, it is not rare to find people who have serious stomach pain constantly, but some we know are more severe than other. Extra care needs to be placed on what we ingest as that plays a significant role in the situation of stomach pain, but in today's topic, we will be considering a type of stomach pain that could become so severe that it gets us dehydrated and what the possible causes are.


Gastroenteritis describes stomach inflammation, alongside small and large intestines, it can be caused by different bacteria, toxins, parasites as well as some other diseases. It is a common condition that causes diarrhea and vomiting, although it is common amongst young children and older adults, it can affect any age group.

When I was in secondary school, a friend of mine began to have some disgusting circular reddish stuff around his legs, we reported it to a senior colleague who laughed at us and told us it was nothing to be worried about, he asked us to get a clean razor blade, scrape off the surface, then apply toothpaste on it. That was too scary for me, because what if, in the process of scrapping, blood begins to rush out and it gets out of control that my friend passes out, I certainly wasn't ready to lose him, so we thanked the senior colleague and went to the school clinic instead.

The nurse in charge identified it as RINGWORM, and treatment was administered appropriately. I told her about the advice from our colleague and she said it was a good thing we did not listen to him, this has reminded me constantly to seek professional help at all times.

Diptheria is in general, an acute respiratory infection, that is characterized by the formation of a pseudomembrane in the throat, but there is a possibility of cutaneous infection.

Humans are the only host of this bacteria, it occurs mainly in the tropics but is available worldwide but with cases rarely found in the United States. After vaccination was introduced, the occurrence of the disease has greatly reduced. Before 1920, there were around 200,000 annual reported cases, but after immunization started, there has been an annual decline in the disease, and now about 1,000 of the case has been reported on an annual basis.

Leprosy is an age-old, chronic infectious disease caused by a bacteria called *Mycobacterium leprae*, the disease affects the peripheral nerves, the eyes the skin,  and the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, now that studies and scientific results have shown that, leprosy is curable, it means those who have been killed or banned in those days were treated unjustly and unfairly. Treating leprosy at an early stage would prevent disability from occurring. Stigmatization, physical deformity, and discrimination are unpleasant experiences of patients affected with leprosy.

Smallpox was a serious disease that caused epidemics all through human history, producing 300-500 million cases of death in the 20th century. Rinderpest on the other hand was the RInderpest case, a deadly bovine disease. Asides from these two, there are existing viruses that have been managed to a reasonable extent. In order for us to state that eradication has happened, according to WHO, it means there is a permanent reduction to a zero level of a worldwide incidence of infection, caused by a specific agent as a result of deliberate efforts.

Some people believe that by now, we shouldn't be having a single case of measles anymore around us, but unfortunately, it has remained an important cause of global mortality and morbidity, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia regions, it gives cases of 100,000 deaths on annual basis regardless of the fact that that there is now a vaccine. Measles is also known as rubeola, it is a preventable but highly contagious acute febrile viral illness, and this is what we will be studying today.

The reason why the other name for measles is rubeola is that it is caused by the virus, and it spreads either in the form of direct contact with the person who has the virus or it spreads through tiny droplets in the air. The disease could result in lifelong complications.

Hello friends, I appreciate your visit to my blog today, I hope you are doing very fine. I have been writing about extinct infectious diseases for some time now, but the topic I will be writing about today is, **Diphtheria** which is a serious infectious disease that as a result of vaccines has strategically reduced its spread, but that is only in highly exposed countries. *C.diptheria* is responsible for endemic and epidemic diseases, it was first described in the 5th century, it manifests in different forms as either an upper respiratory tract or cutaneous infection and it is caused by an aerobic gram-positive bacteria known as *Corynebacterium diphtheria*.

Smallpox used to be a regular thing in the past, but it has gradually gone into extinction alongside other types of infections I have written about in the past, but before smallpox was eradicated, it was a severe infectious disease that was caused by the *Variola virus*, it was a contagious virus that spreads from one person to another, those who had smallpox back then usually had a distinctive fever and a progressive skin rash. A large percentage of people who had smallpox recovered but a few of them also died from the virus, those who recovered from the virus usually have permanent scars over very large areas of their bodies, especially their faces.

For a while, I have been writing on disease types that have gone into extinction, aside from that, it has been a long journey writing on infections and diseases, so the aim of this writing is to write on the stages and spread process of infections. Infection happens when an organism which could be in form of a virus, bacteria, parasites, or fungi invades the body impairing the person's health. In so many cases, an infection could be spread from one person to another either directly or indirectly, it also varies across either a simple case to a complex one.

Not every case of infection leads to disease, but some can actually trigger the immune system, therefore creating different symptoms of illnesses, infection is usually in five stages, we have the; incubation phase, the prodromal phase, the illness phase, the decline phase, and the convalescence phase.

Zika virus is a mosquito-borne virus, identified in Uganda first in the year 1947, it was first discovered in a Rhesus macaque monkey then the evidence of the infection and disease was found in humans in other African countries in the year 1950. Sporadic human infection was then detected across Asia and Africa from 1960 through 1980, in Asia and Africa.

The cases of Zika virus globally had declined since 2017, however, the transmission of the virus persists at low levels in different countries across America and other endemic regions. The first set of local mosquito-transmitted was reported in Europe in 2019 and in India in the year 2021, a number of 89 countries reported cases of mosquito-transmitted Zika virus infection.

The euthyroid sick syndrome is also known as nonthyroidal illness syndrome, this refers to the noticeable changes seen in the thyroid function during the test administered in intensive extensive care, although not a true syndrome, it represents a significant alteration in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in a significant amount of hospitalized patient. The condition appears in patients who have a significant level of critical illness, and those who are deprived of calories, it also comes as an after-effect of some major surgeries.

I was asking a guy who is deep gone into substance abuse why he takes it, and he gave me this response without thinking twice ""There is this compulsion or undying hunger to fill the need with the substance, and cases when he doesn't satisfy this hunger, he can become very uncomfortable, feeling like the world is going to end"". After listening to that, I just confirmed he truly had an addiction to substance abuse. Addiction is a really bad thing, and it interferes with the ability of the person to function properly, fulfill roles, and even maintain relationships. Have you now noticed that in the quest to satisfy this urge, hunger, or compulsion, they end up becoming intoxicated as a result of over using which then keeps then in a physical and a mental state of exhilaration or lethargy.

It's a great day to be alive and I remain extremely thankful for the gift of a platform like Hive at a time like this, today, I will be writing on ''Meningitis''. Meningitis is a fluid inflammation and the inflammation of three membranes that surrounds the spinal cord and the brain. It is often caused as a result of a bacterial or a viral infection, but other associated causes are fungi, cancer, and other types of reactions to drugs. Some of the existing bacterial meningitis is very contagious and could get transmitted through close contact, sneezing, and coughing. 

Different types of bacteria can cause meningitis, but these three are the most frequent ones, we have; *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, Neisseria meningitides*, the N.meningitidis causes meningococcal meningitis, it has an enormous potential of producing large epidemics.

Human Papillomavirus(HPV) is a common virus that can affect different parts of the human body, there are more than 100 different types of HPV, and the strains of HPV could create warts on the face, feet, hands, and out of the over 100 available HPV, around 30 of those strains can affect the genital regions, like the vagina, cervix, penis, scrotum, rectum, vulva and even the anus. The set of HPV that affects the genitals are sexually transmitted infections(STI), they move through skin-to-skin contact, you do not necessarily need to fear the sound of HPV because not all types of HPV actually cause genital warts.

Certain strains of Human Papillomavirus(HPV) are at a high level that could even lead to cancer, like cervical cancer, but early detection and early treatment will definitely prevent this from happening.

I grew up in an area where people are always doing drugs and when they get adicted, withdrawing isn't an easy process. These substances can intoxicate people when taken, and rehabilitation is done when these teenagers and youths are moed to change from taking drugs and during the withdrawal process, the users experience the exact opposite of what they feel when they take the drugs. For instance, if a drug is to excite a person when taken, during withdrawal process, the person would experience depression. I will be discussing these drugs' intoxication and withdrawals one after the other, so without wasting any more time, let's begin.

For the excuse we may have for smoking, we need to also bear in mind that; smoking causes yearly death more than the combination of; HIV, excessive alcohol intake, injuries from cars, and even fire-related diseases.

A few years ago, my big sister decided to go for compulsory youth service in a very rural area against all our advice, we didn't want her to stay in that village because of her health and that place was just too backward, but she wanted to gain the experience of that region, so sh decided to stay there, she said the water consumed by the villagers was a random stream, unkempt water, but for the special visitors a borehole was created, she had to contact someone to regularly bring in drinking water from her from the city, but she was so concerned about the safety of the kids she thought, that she choose to do a water project for them, but the village head declined her offer with the promise that he had plans for them, we haven't see the plan actualize up till date anyways.

Anyways, I have learned that there are several other ways to keep/maintain a healthy weight aside from going to the gym, so I allow her to do her thing, as long as she is able to maintain a healthy weight, then we are good to go. 

Anyways, let's get to the topic of the day, in this post, we will be speaking about obesity and every of its health consequences and I hope that you pick a thing or two from this writing of mine.

I began by explaining that cryptocurrency is a digital form of currency that can be used for various types of exchange including the purchase of goods and services. This transactional exchange is strongly secured by strong linked unbreakable chains. 

The blockchain operates on an open ledger making it very convenient for everyone available on that ledger to see the details of all the transactions carried out on the chain, this open method of transactions gives no room for cheating because both the sender and the receiver can see the details of all transactions carried out.

I have been receiving calls from friend and colleagues asking me to put them through on how they can become designers as well, I really loved to teach them but I lacked the boldness to face a class and lecture them, I just felt I was not good enough for that.

Doing any business at all requires a practical plan which has solid foundations.

A lot of people started a business because they wanted freedom from the 9- to 5 job time, so as to be free to do what you want to do when you want to do it. One mistake I have seen a lot of people make is trying to run away from a 9 - 5 routine only to start a business and end up working all round the clock as they need to keep the business alive as failure isn't an option.

Most times our heads are just filled up with the things that we want to accomplish and how we want to go from the level where we are to the point where we want to be. There is nothing as good as having a feeling of accomplishment, that joy of being able to move from your vision to the level of actualization. 

The world that we live in does not reward or appreciate you for trying, nobody really cares about how well you have tried but people only reward and celebrate someone who has attained a level of great accomplishment, someone who did something differently or who sacrificed so much to get it right.

Working with time and working effectively are the two ways to show that a person is productive. There are a few apps that can help with improving the productivity of a person and I will be going through a few ones.


In order to be productive, a person needs regular break, time to work as well as relax properly. When a person sleeps late or at the wrong time, the ability to be productive the following day will be difficult. A very good app that can help is TIDE. The app gives scenery sounds such as ocean side, rain, relaxing music and so many other functions which helps to focus on work, reading,  writing, studying and so on. One could do breathing exercise with the app, making the app very good for relaxation, meditation and other forms of rest.

We value solid relationships but sometimes those relationships are too toxic for us to get any benefit from, our life is a reflection of the type of humans we surround ourselves with and a basic knowledge needs to be obtained to keep our focus.

Little wonder a lot of companies spend money on marketing so they can have improved and increased sales. It is no doubt the TV/or internet commercials are advertisement of less than 120 seconds which depict what the product is, why you need it and why you can’t do without it. This is the goal or target of advertising or commercials.

The truth is no one is above mistake but a typo of such amount is really bad for business. The company decided to honor their customers even though they would lose over $7.7 million dollars.

I tried to post on aspects I am good at but it looked like people didn’t find my post interesting. But I am willing to give it a trial again after a friend Joseph asked me to give it another try.

#### My Second Trial
Wow, I just knew today that there is a fork of Steemit called Hive. I came back to steemit and started posting as my friend advice then I started seeing an account voting my post @steemcurator06 and also giving me a link to a community. I just dropped a first post on hive and I hope to do more on both steem and hive also, I will love to see people leave comments on my post while I will do the same.
