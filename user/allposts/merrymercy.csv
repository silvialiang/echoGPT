Noncommunicable diseases(NCD) are extremely chronic, they tend to exist in the human body for a long duration and eventually turn out to be disastrous.  NCDs are a combination of genetic, physical, environmental as well as behavioral combinations.

NCDs mostly affect people who belong to the low and middle-income earners categories, in these regions, there is a recorded high death rate, about 31.4 million cases of death resulting from NCD, which is a lot. Asides from the fact that NCD affects mostly low-income earners, it also affects other people from different walks of life, it affects people regardless of age group, country, and region. However, people who belong to the higher age group, are actually at a higher risk of getting infected.

Amphioxus is a marine organism that lives beneath the bottom of the body of water, buried in the shallow sand of the sea. Being easily mistaken for fishes in the river, Amphioxus are about 8cm long and are regarded as one of the origins of cordates.

I was watching some video clips with a friend and a slide showed a man whose teeth were literally rotten, I thought it was not possible to have teeth that bad, it would have been some editing obs done there, but my friend insisted that she has seen someone whose teeth was as bad as that, and I just couldn't figure out the possibility of having such a bad tooth. The teeth are a sensitive part of the body that requires special attention and care.

Enamel is the hard outer part of a tooth, the progress of tooth decay affects the really deep layers of the tooth resulting in cavities, and the consistency of tooth decay eventually results in bigger complications which lead to cavities. Adequate treatment can help prevent the spread of tooth decay.

Tooth decay is also called dental caries or simply called cavities, this tooth decay is a disease that creates the breakdown of tooth enamel. Once the enamel has been completely enveloped, cavities begin to form around the teeth.

A few days ago, I wrote about the scientific breakdown of antibiotics,  and why antimicrobials may have an adverse effect on our health, but I did not mention what really happens to the body when we put it through an excessive intake of antimicrobials and that is what I will be writing about today. If you have not read my previous post, read about it [Here](https://ecency.com/hive-196387/@merrymercy/the-overuse-of-antibiotics).

The benefit and risk associated with the use of antimicrobials remain a controversial and complex issue, especially with the several benefited claims that have not been demonstrated on a large scale.  This, however, does not change the fact that there are benefits and downsides to the use of antimicrobial drugs.

Hello lovely friends, welcome to my page, I want to write about endocrine disorders today, but certainly, it would only be wise to write about the endocrine system first, before we proceed to talk about what endocrine disorders are. An endocrine system is a group consisting of organs and glands, this collection is responsible for the collection of organs and glands which are responsible for the regulation of bodily processes using hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers in the body that moves through the bloodstream, the purpose of the hormonal movement through the bloodstream is basically to influence the process of the body. The endocrine remains significantly important as it, influences heartbeats controls the growth of tissue and organ, it even controls the ability to make babies as well.

If I were asked to pick one of either fish or beef to consume for a week, I will gladly go for fish, and I am sure that a lot of us will go for fish (sincerely, I like beef, but I will prefer fish). Fish is no doubt a healthy food to eat, and it is advisable to eat at least 12 ounces of fish (two average meals) a week. It is advisable that we eat up to this amount because fish provides the body with many nutrients, and a good source of Omega-3 fatty acid, especially with fishes such as Mackerel, Salmon, Tuna, Trout, Sardine, Sprats, and Herring, are good sources. On the brighter side, eating fish is said to help reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke, since Omega-3 reduces the level of triglycerides, and reduce the growth of plagues in the artery.

I know of people who would normally love to shave their hair completely and may not even notice the presence of a hair fall out as they shave it off completely as soon as it grows, but unfortunately, the case is not true for everyone as there are people, who would never stand a thing happen to their precious hair without making a move to save it. There are different reasons behind hair loss and different process to the fall out of hair loss, the determination of the category of hair loss process happening to your hair is highly dependent on the manner at which it falls off.

I and my friend went to swim in a public pool yesterday, and you can trust that you would see different types of people with different habits. Actually, let me call it, we went to have fun at the pool side because we ended up not swimming, this is because I do not like swimming in a pool with lots of people, I always end up not liking the clinical after effect on my health but my friend doesn't fight this whenever she swims either in a public pool or a private pool. For yesterday, I was able to convince her to not swim but let's watch the entire event. We had fun and while we were sat there sipping our drinks, we saw a pregnant woman who was consuming alcoholic beverage heavily. My friend in a joking form said she was sure the fetus would be intoxicated already. We laughed over it, and then we saw a man coming to caution her.

The urge to get better sexual satisfaction is increasing on a regular and people are doing so much to enjoy their sexual relationships more. In a bid to spice things up, various sexual enhancements have been introduced, but the question is, are these sexual enhancements options always safe? For the sake of this publication, we will be focusing on men's enhancement, the danger, and the associated benefits.

A lot of men have complained about having difficulty getting an erection at some point in their lives, please bear in mind that having erectile dysfunction occasionally, does not necessarily signify erectile dysfunction (ED) but when sexual activities become painfully difficult or impossible, it signifies the presence of erectile dysfunction. Possible factors that could increase the possibility of erectile dysfunction are; diabetes, age, smoking, anxiety, depression, excessive alcoholism, diabetes, and even obesity.

Cancer is a disease where cells in the body grow beyond their usual size and become uncontrollable. Cancer can originate from anywhere in the body as a malignant growth and replication on its site of location. There are numerous types of cancers with different names, but today, I will be discussing Thyroid Cancer. Thyroid cancer is cancer of the thyroid gland which is an endocrine gland located at the anterior part of the neck region. The Thyroid gland has a butterfly shape and it releases thyroid hormones which are vital to the body's functions. These hormones include; Triiodothyronine (T3), and Thyroxine (T4) which are responsible for mentation, movement, and metabolism.

Hello everyone, I hope you are having a blissful week. Anyways, my week is still going, and it is a stressful one. You can also tell me how your week is going in the comment section. In my last post, I talked about *Staphylococcus aureus*, and today, I will be diving more into the microbial world and will still be writing on Staphylococcus. You can read my previous post if you haven't but I will do my best to explain Staphylococcus Aureus, Staphylococcus  Epidermidis, and Staphylococcus Saprophytical in this post. This said, let's begin.

#### <center>Structure and Characteristics of Staphylococcus Species</center>

Let me quickly explain what Staphylococcus means. Staphs are bacteria in clusters, and cocci mean spherical, round, or berry-like. So Staphylococcus bacteria can be said to be bacteria that are clusters of spheres in shape. All Staphylococcus bacteria are gram-positive bacteria, with thick peptidoglycan layer which allows them to retain the crystal-violet stain.

Hi everyone, it's good to have you here today, and in this post, I will be discussing bacteria endotoxins and exotoxins. To understand this topic, we need to first identify which bacteria produce endotoxins and which bacteria produce exotoxins. In my last post, I explained that gram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrane, and endotoxin is present in the outer membranes of the bacteria. This means that gram-negative bacteria are the group of bacteria that possess endotoxin and like I said in my previous post that the toxin is called lipopolysaccharides (I dare you to say that name fast 7 times, you might lose a tooth). Don't forget in your bacteriology or microbiology, you were told that lipopolysaccharides components are made up of the bacterial chromosome and are of three parts, the lipid A, the core polysaccharide, and the O antigen (I wrote that in my previous post if you could just go back and read it).

In every country, the health sector is a thing that should not be taken for granted at all, the health of citizens should come first, but because of the high level of greed and wickedness we have in my country, the leaders usually fly themselves and members of their family out of the country to treat even very little ailments, they do not care about what happens to the citizens, so the money meant for the building and development of hospitals, is used to boost the net worth of one politician.

 I am not here to tell you about how bad the situation of things in my country has gotten, but it has gotten very bad. Anyways, I had to mention that, because last weekend I saw a woman who was rushed to an under-established hospital and she was treated by a nurse who gave her excessive Intravenous fluid(IV), what we popularly call Drip over here. According to the story I heard, she started to put on excessive weight and there had to be a health examination on what the problem really was.

Stomach ulcers are another name for gastric ulcers, which are painful sores in the stomach lining, stomach ulcer is just a type of existing peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcers are ulcers affecting both the stomach and small intestines, they are open sores that develop in the lining of the esophagus, stomach,, or the first part of the small intestine known as the duodenum.

Some people who have peptic ulcers do not often show signs or symptoms, but when the symptoms are shown, upper abdominal pain is often the most common one. Abdominal pain can affect any angle from the navel up to the breastbone, usually following these patterns;
* Feeling worse when the stomach is empty.
* Getting worse at night.
* Temporarily feeling better after eating or after taking an antacid.
* Comes and goes for days or weeks.

Have you experienced constipation before?  Almost everyone would have experienced constipation at least once in their lifetime. Constipation can go from not having a bowel movement for days, to indigestion, but it isn't a funny experience at all. In this post, I will be discussing constipation firsthand.

One thing that is a factor when it has to do with constipation is Transit Time which is the time taken for the stool moves from the cecum to the end of the large intestine which is the colon. When food leaves get to the small intestine, nutrients are absorbed and sent to the large intestine. When the waste gets to the large intestine, it is very mashy and in liquid form but as the waste goes along the large intestine, water is absorbed and the feces become solid before it gets to the rectum. If we are to be sincere, this means that when there is excessive absorption of water in the large intestine, the feces will be extremely solid making it difficult to be passed out of the body","{""image"":[""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Leech_scoring_areas.jpg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Leech_scoring_areas.jpg"",""https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2021/09/25/16/32/constipation-6655333_1280.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""biology"",""stemng"",""stemgeeks"",""constipation"",""science"",""waivio"",""neoxian"",""bee"",""alive""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.31-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[0.9109375,0,0.98828125]}",2023-05-14 00:48:18,Constipation - Lifestyle and Dietary Factors Causing Constipation,/hive-196387/@merrymercy/constipation-lifestyle-and-dietary-factors,4

I saw Lola about 1 year ago, and she was very fleshy. I wouldn't refer to her as obese but she had some weight on and was always complaining. She would always complain about her weight and how she would love to look. Some days ago, she said she was coming to visit me, and I couldn't identify her. She had undergone Bariatric Surgery and had lost weight. She said, although she had the surgery, she still had to do a lot fo exercise, change in lifestyle, and she said while the surgery was good, she also did well to change her lifestyle. This surgery can be done in three forms which are the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy but for the sake of this post, I will be looking at Sleeve Gastrectomy which is the cutting of the stomach to a smaller size.

I have always wondered how ants have been able to live through generations and maintain their colonies. I was sitting at my backyard, and I saw a specie of ant known as Eciton burchellii which we refer to as soldier ants in Nigeria and possible other regions because they are very fierce and would attack anything that crosses their path. It was this that got me to start thinking about ants and how they live.


I've always been fascinated by ants and how they thrive across generations while maintaining their colonies. Despite humans being considered the most intelligent animals with a global presence, ants outnumber us by a significant margin. With a population of 20 quadrillion, which is equivalent to 20 million billion, ants can be found almost everywhere on land.

If I were to conduct a survey on chocolates, it would be evident that they are loved by many. While I personally believe milk chocolates are the best, opinions differ, with some preferring dark chocolates despite their slight bitterness, while others avoid orange chocolates for various reasons. We all share a common love for chocolates, but our preferences and reservations differ greatly. Surprisingly, many of us are unaware of the complex composition of chocolates.

As a child, my mum would yell at us if we bite our fingers with our teeth. She would even spank us in very worse cases. We didn't see it as a bad thing, at least I and my siblings didn't but over the years when we see adults doing such, it looks very odd, and then we start to think of what she did as a lifesaver. If you are one of those people who still bite your fingernails, then you might need to stop because I will be uncovering something you didn't know about biting your nails that could even cost you your life if not quickly treated.

Nail biting is often an unconscious act, driven by boredom, anxiety, stress, frustration, or even excitement. While a bit of swelling and redness around the nail area might seem ordinary for chronic nail biters, there's a more sinister consequence that can arise. Picture this: a greenish tinge develops where the nail meets the skin, indicating the presence of a condition called Paronychia.

We embark on a voyage into the enigmatic realm of cold therapy, delving deep into its promised benefits, the enigmas of cryotherapy, and the compelling narrative of Justin Smith. Can the frigid touch hold the key to rejuvenation? Does cold therapy possess the latent power to invigorate our bodies and usher in newfound vitality? Join us as we embark on this expedition to uncover the myriad dimensions of cold therapy.

On February 21, 2015, Justin Smith was said to have frozen to death by Paramedics after the 25-year-old had stayed in the cold for about 12 hours but after the interference of doctors, he was resuscitated to life. This event brought about different arguments, as well as a new field of medicine where freezing bodies were used to save them, and that therapy is known as Cold Therapy.

Regarded as a genius, he is known for his groundbreaking contribution to science especially the world of theoretical physics but then, he was human I guess because in the 1930s and 1940s, Einstein had serious abdominal pain.

This abdominal pain plague was severe that it got him to go see his friend Dr. Rudolph Nissen (1896 -1981) the pioneering surgeon behind Nissen Fundoplication in 1955, a surgery used to treat severe cases of GERD, a condition in which stomach acid flows back (reflux) into the esophagus, causing heartburn, inflammation, and damage to the esophagus lining.

Hormones, a word familiar to teenagers, youths, and adults alike. We hear it in classrooms, medical clinics, and in the realm of science. But this intricate system governing our bodies through chemical messengers was not always common knowledge. In this exploration, we embark on a journey to unravel the fascinating history of hormones.

In the 1700s, we knew that the spleen and thyroids dumped chemicals into the blood to modify bloods but we didn't see any of those as being related to hormones. Before the knowledge of hormone existence, scientist thought that the only the body could communicate with itself was through the nervous system and while we saw certain hormone glands like the testes and ovaries, scientist didn't really know what they were about but this changed with Dr Arnold Berthold.

An ACL injury happens, when there is a sprain or a tear in the anterior cruciate, which happens to be one of the strong bands of the tissue that helps connect your thigh bone (the femur) to the shinbone (tibia).

With the occurrence of ACL, many patients will feel a popping sensation happening with the knee, which may lead to a swell, an unstable feeling, or intense pain that makes it very difficult to bear any type of weight and that results in the stop of current activity, an unstable feeling, and fast swelling.

It is commonly grown in northern Africa and Western Asia but it can be planted in all part of the world.

It's been thousands of years that humans have suffered from malaria. In ancient Egypt, it is said that malaria occurred in lowland regions, evidence of this could be seen on the enlarged spleens of some Egyptian mummies, and this happens to be a surviving trace of its presence.

Ancient Greece experienced malaria, which appeared on an annual base as an autumnal fever.

Have you noticed that you can buy a drug with a brand name that will be very expensive, and at the same time buy the same generic version of the same drug cheaper. The generic usually have the same main ingredient, same dosage, and even the same effect on the body, yet the brand name is more expensive than the generic one. Most times I wonder if this is because one works better than the other but at the end, we realize that they do the same job. So how did this happen and how do people or company begin to own chemicals?

In the 1900s, getting drugs was basically simple as people were either getting Ethical drugs, or Patent drugs. Ethical medicines were drugs that had positive effect which was documented on the body and these drugs included Quinine, Aspirin,  Digitalis, and other drugs that were known to have positive effects.

Chest pain is one type f pain that a lot of people feel on a regular, and it has become a thing that once a person presents with chest pain, the first thing we consider is a cardiac arrest. It is always important to look at the worse case scenario but then, chest pain can also be as a result of non cardiac issues. In this post, I will be discussing chest pain in detail but first what is the chest and how does its pain differ from one another?

When we mention chest pain, it is a broad term for pains that can occur in different region of the thoracic region.  Someone who just stressed their Pectoralis major muscle would claim they have chest pain whereas they do not have chest pain. Since it is very difficult to make precise, people have termed any pain that occurs after the neck but before a abdomen chest pain.

For some people, however, their dry skin is an all-year-round thing, it is not just limited to the harmattan season alone, and it could get so serious that the dry skin becomes a worrisome thing. Dry skin always makes the skin look flaky or scaly, and of course, it feels rough too, this dry skin condition can affect people of all ages.

Antibiotics has become a part of our world but it wasn't so in the past. We know that Big Pharma make tonnes of  money from drug production but it wasn't so with penicillin in world war 2. This is because the government paid lots of pharma companies to create it and flood the market with it, but while they didn't make much money from penicillin, they understood that they can do more research on different soil bacteria and fungi just to find antibiotics to treat other infections. In 1948, Lederle Laboratories came out with Aureomycin which was a reference to the gold bacteria they got the drug from, also it would refer to how much money they made from it.

Many of us share our homes with pets, forming strong bonds with dogs, cats, mice, or various other domestic animals. However, what might surprise you is that our beloved pets can sometimes be carriers of diseases that can affect our health.

Multiple Sclerosis is characterized by a variety of common symptoms and the progression can vary from patients to patients which might occur and vanish after a while.

The progression can differ from one person to another, and symptoms can change overtime. For instance, a person suffering from multiple sclerosis can have blurry vision in one eyes but after 2 weeks, the blur vision can disappear after which two years later, can experience numbness in the left leg and arm but after 4 weeks, can recover from the numbness as though it didn't happen before then suddenly experience gait instability for about a month, recover and then the symptoms can progress to the point where the symptoms can become  permanent.

You might have heard about the Nobel Prize in Medicine awarded to Selman Waksman in 1952 for his groundbreaking discovery of Streptomycin, the first effective medicine against tuberculosis. Interestingly, while Waksman received the accolade, one of his students, Albert Schatz, played a crucial role in the development, having his name on the Streptomycin patent and the scientific paper introducing the drug.

The discovery of Streptomycin started from Robert Koch in the 1880s where he discovered the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis to be the causative bacteria for the disease tuberculosis. With improved hygiene, the transmission of the disease reduced but while this was functional a little, there wasn't a drug to treat the disease. Although there was a vaccine to treat the disease, it wasn't effective.

If there's a lesson gleaned from Agatha Christie novels, it's the unsettling ease with which arsenic can transition from a household item to a lethal poison. Odorless, tasteless, and discreetly dissolvable, arsenic has a notorious reputation, yet it has a complex history that extends beyond its sinister associations.

In the 1800s, Arsenic was a common substance that was an household item and people wouldn't see anything awkward about buying it until in the 1830s where it was discovered in post-mortem study. We could say that for the most of the 19th century arsenic was not regulated. Although it has a very potent poison, it has been very helpful in the world of medicine from being a leukemia drug and was even one of the earliest effective antibiotics for syphilis.

The concept of humors has been a recurring theme in many of my previous posts when discussing illness and the evolution of modern medicine. Bloodletting, emetics, leeching, and various other age-old medical practices are firmly rooted in the ancient theory of humors.

The four humors would take into consideration blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile, and they were meant to be in balance, and when they were not in balance, these would be a problem leading to being sick. This was a theory that doctors used a lot at that time and I do not know if I should say it worked or not. If a person had too much blood, a hole will be poked into the body of the person to leak out blood from the person, and so on.

The question arises: How did this theory come into being, and why did it persist for so long, even though it was based on limited empirical evidence?

Foxglove, a charming and vibrant flowering plant, has an intriguing history in the realm of medicine, particularly in the treatment of heart diseases. However, it is not, as the name might suggest, a fox wearing a glove but a significant player in the evolution of cardiac treatments.

In the 1700s, the quest for heart disease remedies was a challenging endeavor. While humans have been searching for a treatment for heart disease, it was difficult to get this at the time because we had a sketchy understanding of the hearth physiology, it was close to impossible. Scientists like Hippocrates believed in the Humor theory of disease where disease had to do with the balance of the fluids in humans, where an imbalance would mean being sick. The humors were blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile.

In the face of pandemics, both in our modern era and the world of the past, it's fascinating to explore how people in bygone days coped with health crises that we continue to confront today. These historical perspectives provide insight into the evolution of medical knowledge and innovation.

By 1918, scientist already understood what vaccines were as there were vaccines for small pox, and the plaque at that time but then, there was no vaccine for influenza at that time. At the end of the 19th century, the acceptance of germ theory, the use of microscope, and proper hygiene was a thing in the world of medicine. With germ theory, it was a consensus that specific germs caused specific diseases, as people now agreed that it wasn't the wrath of the gods, or poisoned air that caused diseases, rather it was caused by specific viruses, and bacteria and with Koch's postulate, it was possible to identify a particular germ that caused a disease.

Concussions are not uncommon; many have experienced their disorienting effects. These head injuries often lead to symptoms like disorientation and sensitivity to light. But what exactly is a concussion? According to the American Academy of Neurology, a concussion is a biomedically induced alteration of brain function that affects memory and orientation, and it may or may not involve a loss of consciousness.

Concussions typically occur when individuals experience a blow to the head. The symptoms of a concussion usually subside over time, but individuals who have had concussions in the past are at a higher risk of experiencing them again. Repeated head trauma can even lead to permanent brain conditions, such as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE).

During the pandemic, the plague doctor mask was common, and while it looks creepy today, it was iconic then. It's beak was filled with tobacco, flowers, herbs and lots of substances that smelled nice compared to the corpses that they were carrying or the people they were treating. This was because in the 14th century, physicians were concerned about smell because of the believe that diseases spread through putrid ad poisonous air. They used the Miasma theory, and we will be discussing about the Miasma theory in this post.

In my previous post, I delved into the significance of penicillin in the history of medicine and its role in combating bacterial infections. Many people have hailed penicillin as the groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized the treatment of bacterial diseases, often stating that before its advent, fatalities from these infections were alarmingly common. However, it's essential to explore whether penicillin was indeed the first drug designed to combat bacterial infections or if there were other earlier contenders in the battle against bacteria.

To answer this question, we must begin by gaining a fundamental understanding of antibiotics and the intriguing world of bacteria. While we humans are Eukaryotes with our DNA wrapped in a nucleus, bacteria are prokaryotes as they do not have their genetic material surrounded by nucleus. In addition to the cell membrane, bacteria also possesses a cell wall made up of peptidoglycan.

Penicillin is the world's most famous antibiotics, and Alexander Fleming is famous for the discovery but then, how did Penicillin become the antibiotics of choice for treating bacteria infection.

To get a glimpse of how penicillin left the lab bench to the pharmacy counter, we will need to look at the beginning in 1906 where Almroth Wright employed Flemming when trying to increase his inoculation department after developing the first vaccine against typhoid fever. He was going to need Fleming to assist on improving his research on Vaccines and antiseptics to treat various infectious disease.

I do not know how someone would decide to completely stop the intake of salt, that sounds really weird to me because I cannot even imagine what it would take to completely quit salt intake. Here are things that happen to the body when there is a complete stop to the intake of salt.

* There is a drop in the risk of developing kidney stones: Excessive salt intake increases the chances of developing kidney stones. Kidney stones are little, hard deposits that are made up of salt and minerals that form inside the kidney, the fact that I mentioned they are small does not mean they can't find a way to make themselves visible through the pain they bring.

I previously was of the opinion that meningitis only had an effect on children, but I was of the wrong opinion as it not only has an effect on infants but even adults can get affected too. 

What exactly is Meningitis? It is an inflammation of the fluid and three membranes that surrounds the spinal cord and the brain. These membranes are known as Meninges. The most common forms of these infections are bacterial and viral, but less commonly, they can also be caused by fungi, cancer, and other drug-induced reactions. Some bacterial and viral meningitis are transmissible, and can be transmitted through close contact, sneezing, and coughing.

The role of our senses in shaping how our brains process and perceive the world is undeniably fascinating. Among these senses, our eyes stand out as the primary conduits for understanding our surroundings. While you might argue otherwise, it's a well-established fact that, when it comes to learning, perception, and cognition, vision holds the lion's share, contributing to roughly 80% to 85% of our sensory input. In contrast, hearing accounts for about 11%, smell around 3.5%, touch 1.5%, and taste a mere 1%.

 Scientists have been able to show that what we eat is a viable way to avoid, treat, or even lessen mental illnesses. According to records, over 200 million people suffer from anxiety, and over 300 million people suffer from depression worldwide. With the rise in these numbers, scientists have been looking for new ways to prevent and treat anxiety as well as depression. In this post, we'll delve into what scientists are uncovering about the intriguing connection between what we eat and our mental well-being.

The relationship between food and mental health is not a new concept. Throughout history, various dietary practices have been explored, often with surprising consequences. Take, for instance, Anorexia Mirabilis, an ancient practice of extreme fasting that aimed to elevate the soul but led to hallucinations and altered mental states due to chronic starvation.

Our parents had cautioned us that such an injury might result in the inability to walk, and we had a stark example in a popular Nigerian artist who had experienced this fate.

According to the World Health Organization, between 250,000 to 500,000 people suffer from spinal cord injuries annually. While therapies and treatments have offered partial mobility to many, full recovery from these injuries remains elusive. However, the realm of science provides hope for a brighter future, with stem cell treatments showing promising potential to facilitate complete recovery.

While I did not check the percentage of people not doing exercise in your country, there is a possibility that you do not engage in any physical form of exercise. This might be different in underdeveloped countries where they have to do lots of physical activities on a daily basis like walking long distances or farming all day.

HIV is often regarded by many as a terminal illness, yet it's important to understand that it doesn't necessarily equate to a death sentence. There exist other diseases and conditions that truly lack treatments or cures, rendering them far more dire. So, for those who may know someone living with HIV, it's crucial to convey that it isn't an automatic death sentence.

In the context of Lagos, Nigeria, statistics reveal that approximately 1.3% of its population, which exceeds 20 million, is living with HIV. Tragically, in 2021, around 2500 individuals lost their lives to AIDS. While methods to manage HIV are known, the reality persists that over 6000 new infections occur daily, resulting in a significant loss of lives. This ongoing concern, however, is not met with complacency from the scientific community. Scientists continue to dedicate immense efforts toward crafting a vaccine that could ultimately conquer HIV.

I went to visit a friend of mine yesterday, and I saw a TV show named Big Brother Naija. I have heard people talk about it, but it has never gotten my attention because I feel it is a complete waste of time but since I was a visitor at my friend's home and they were actually, seeing the reality TV show, I grudgingly sat and was just seeing how they were living for the moment. While I was not fascinated by the event, something caught my attention. There was a lady referred to as Angel who wore about 6 cologne and perfumes and I wondered if she was actually safe with her actions. This got me to do a little bit of reading on the use of cologne or perfume and if it had any health impact.

A lot of people are fond of wearing colognes that they have numerous ones in their bags. Once they are done with any activity, they go straight to spraying, or using their deodorants, to help them have nice scents, covering the terrible smell they had prior to the application.

The intricate journey of how life begins and flourishes has captivated human curiosity for ages. Today, we delve into the captivating world of reproduction, shedding light on the remarkable process that brings us into existence.

While some claim that the odds of being born are as rare as 1 in 400 quadrillion or 400 trillion, the precise origin of these numbers remains elusive. Regardless, it's safe to say that each individual's journey into existence is a unique and special occurrence. Amidst the myriad of possibilities, the creation of life begins with the fusion of a single spermatozoon with an egg. Out of the hundreds of millions of sperm cells, only one lucky contender wins the race to fertilize the egg, a remarkable feat orchestrated by the wonders of science.

Our bodies are marvels of complexity, constantly working behind the scenes to keep us alive and thriving. While we go about our daily routines, our bodies are engaged in a myriad of fascinating processes to maintain equilibrium and ensure our well-being.

To begin, you must have been told that the human temperature when healthy is around 37 degrees celsius. Why does the body stay around this temperature and how does it maintain it is a question a lot of people do not bother to ask. The body maintains the temperature by expanding the blood vessels allowing for more blood to pass, in a process known as vasodilation, allowing for sweat thereby helping the body cool down, and when the temperature is cold, the vessel constricts, leading to shivering and warming up.

One major concern for me when I fall sick or I'm traveling is not getting blood if there is a need for a blood transfusion. At our hospital, we do not have lots of O- blood because of a lot of circumstances and the large one being it is not common. People who bring their wives who are close to the EDD would have to donate blood if their blood matches with theirs of their wives or would have to start procuring blood for cases where need might arise. The blood typeing thing might not be a problem to some, but it is sure a problem to others, especially people who have rarer blood then mine. This made me study to find out if scientists have been working on getting the O- blood group more available so as to help save lifes.

Vitamin supplements have become a ubiquitous presence in our lives, thanks to pervasive advertisements and social media promotions. Certain companies even reward individuals based on the volume of vitamin supplements they sell, a common practice in multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes. The opinions on vitamin supplements are as diverse as the products themselves, some experts praise them as life-savers, others deem them a waste of time, and a few caution about potential dangers, citing research that links excessive intake to an increased risk of cancer.

The prevalence of vitamin supplement consumption is staggering, with a survey in the United States revealing that a significant 86% of Americans take vitamins or supplements. While these supplements undoubtedly offer benefits, can they also pose a threat to our health?

Our bodies are comprised of trillions of cells, forming a vast interconnected ecosystem. Hence, the human body is not simply a singular entity but rather a complex amalgamation of various organisms coexisting within it. However, while the human body allows for the presence of certain microbes, the immune system views the entry of many microbes as an invasion and responds accordingly. Though our immune system works tirelessly to maintain our well-being, are we truly immune to all diseases and pathogens?

While it takes years for us to grow from infancy to adulthood, a bacterium a unicellular organism can replicate itself within a matter of minutes, and viruses can multiply exponentially in just a few hours. Consider the immense challenge our immune system faces on a regular basis, combating viruses, bacteria, and various other microbes that can rapidly proliferate. The immune system may sometimes struggle to mount an immediate and complete defense against such formidable foes.

Whenever I passed through the refuse dump, two things that were common were plastic bottles used to pack bottled water and soft drinks, and sachet for water that is referred to as pure water in Nigeria. A lot of us like to take carbonated beverages, and I take a lot of pure water as well since it is quite cheaper than bottled water but there isn't an alternative when it comes to taking carbonated drinks. Let me focus this post on writing about the effect of this plastic after being used.

Let's discuss parasites a little bit, and talk about how they take advantage of so many lives instead of just one. C'mon, let's not crucify parasites like they are the demons in our world, they actually have some good just have they have their bad. Before we continue with the good and the bad of parasites, let's quickly define them.

To define parasite, let's take a look at people we refer to as party crashers who are not willing to put any work into getting the party started or running, but are just interested in leeching on every opportunity that shows up in the party and is willing to have every meal to themselves.  Now that you understand that, take the party as another organism, and the party crashers as parasites. they can exist in different forms of life, from cells to tissues, and so on. The job of these hosts is to provide food, shelter, and ground to breed (like you have to provide a place for them to have fun and procreate).

Fascioliasis has its history as far as Francesco Redi, Carl Linneaus who named the parasite, and Friedrick Leuckart who desceibed the life cycle of Faciola hepatica.

Lice! This is one crawling insect that we are conversant with, as it can be found on animals as well as on humans. There are two types of lice that infest humans commonly, and they are head lice and body lice. The head lice are known as Pediculus humanus capitis while the body louse is known as Pediculus Humanus Corporis. These two types of lice aren't the only types of lice that affect humans, the pubic lice (Pthirus pubis) also infest humans. Lice are ectoparasite, meaning that they live outside of your body. There are over 530 species of lice parasitizing different mammals and over 5000 species of lice in total. Lice live for only about 30 days on average and in this short period of time, they eat, mate, and reproduce.

Beaver fever is a zoonotic infection that can spread from one specie to another and its reservoir is the beaver, but can also be transmitted via stool from dogs, cats, and other primates. When humans get infected, the infection can be transmitted from one person to another.

Epidemiologically, it has been found worldwide that Giardiasis is a major diarrheal disease since it is an intestinal parasite, and it is the most diagnosed intestinal parasite in the United States with a prevalence of about 1.2 million with lots of cases not identified as carriers can be asymptomatic. It has a high prevalence in children, and high-risk groups of the infection are travelers, immunocompromised people, and in sexually active homosexuals.

Hello everyone, today I will like us to look at microbiology and infectious disease, and on that note, we will take a look at the microbiology of Clostridia. While some people do not know the genus name Clostridium, they must have heard the word Tetanus. Sit back and let us share with ourselves, what we should know about Clostridium.

Clostridia has four major clinically important species which are Clostridium Botulinum, Perfringens, difficile, and tetani. Clostridium Botulinum causes Botulism, Clostridium Tetani causes Tetanus, Clostridium perfringens causes myone necrosis and food poisoning, and Clostridium  Pseudomembranous colitis. For a quick explanation, Clostridium is gram-positive spore-forming rod bacteria that are mostly strictly anaerobic and are mostly motile such as C.botulinum, C.tetani, and C.defficile but a non-motile Clostridium is C.perfringens. These aren't the only specie of Clostridium, but we are discussing these ones in this post.

Pernicious Anemia is common in people between the age of 40 and 70 years old but it can also occur in infants less than the age of 2 years known as Congenital pernicious anemia and it has a higher prevalence in families who have had a previous history or affected individuals who have a genetic predisposition such as human leukocyte antigen serotype A3, A2 and B7. People who also have type A blood group also have a high prevalence. Pernicious Anemia may occur along with other autoimmune conditions such as vitiligo, diabetes mellitus type 1, and autoimmune thyroid disease. It is found to be the disease in 25% of patients with autoimmune gastric conditions.

Does science explain when two opposite sex can enjoy coitus, or does it explain when we can have productive intercourse

The male testes which is made up of seminiferous tubules produces sperm cells, and the sperm cells are produced in large number. While males produce sperm cells at an alarming rate, it takes beyond sperm production continuously. The male testosterone level is very high in the morning, which comes with increased sex drive and that is a good reason why males usually have an erection in the morning. Males would be sure to have an increased performance in the morning. Endorphins and oxytocin are also high in the morning and these hormones are responsible for connection and bonding.

CRISPR possesses RNA genomes that provide the scripts to match the DNA code in the Genome of the organism. It is common in bacteria as it is used to protect itself from viral DNA by cutting viral DNA. Bacteria uses CRISPR as their immune system against viruses where the organism saves the genome of the virus in their CRISPR Locus and the DNA is used as a template to Syntensize RNA molecules which are similar. The RNA finds the matching DNA and then CAS9 cuts theaway the DNA in the genome affected thereby preventing the virus from completely overcoming the bacteria.

I will like to write today on a topic that a large number of people may consider just minor, but in the real look of things, it is a highly significant and necessary topic that is a must to be studied for the safety and well-being of our health. Food is one vital activity that cannot be pushed aside, even if we know that fasting is good and healthy, there has to be a point of a fast break when we get to eat again, but it is not just okay to eat and eat, it is very mandatory however, that while we eat, it has to be nutritional and healthy. 

The food we put into our body will add a high-range significant effort to our body, especially when it is related to the heart, physical inactivity, weight gain, high blood pressure, stress, obesity, and high blood pressure can significantly increase the possibility of heart diseases and different cancers. The nature of the food we take in provides our system with the rightful information required for appropriate functioning.

Food digestion is somewhat of a systemic method which can be explained from one step to another. When we ingest food, we begin mechanical digestion where the saliva mixes with food in the process of chewing. Saliva contains Amylase which is the first breaking down process of carbohydrate. The food goes goes through the epiglottis which is a flexible flap at the end of the larynx, acting as a switch between the larynx and the esophagus. The food goes to the esophagus which is a muscular tube that connects the throat and the stomach together. The esophagus functions with peristaltic action to allow food get into the stomach. In the stomach, the food is mixed and Hydrochloric acid (HCl) which aids digestion of the food. The food is turned to mash and sent to the small intestine where absorption of nutrients and minerals takes place. With alcohol, its digestion is different.

There are a lot of diseases, it is important to know that not all medical cases are diseases. Some are dysfunctions, disorders, and conditions. In this post, we will be discussing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) which is a result of a hormonal disorder that leads to a condition that is made up of a constellation of symptoms, and its causes are not fully understood but you trust that we scientist will always have something meaningful and factual about it. As the name implies, Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has to do with multiple cysts in the ovary. While the etiology is unknown, there is a high risk of having polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) which includes obesity, insulin resistance, type 1 and 2 gestational diabetes, first-degree relatives with Polycystic ovary syndrome (genetics), and Premature Adrenarche.

Good morning to you great friends, today, I will like to write on Antimicrobial resistance, I don't know how familiar you are with antimicrobial medications, but where I come from it is very common, especially coupled with the fact that self-medication is also very common over here also. Antimicrobial resistance happens when germs like fungi and bacteria, develop the ability to defeat the drugs that have been previously designed to destroy them, so while we take in medications with the aim of destroying these germs, they do not die, rather they continue to grow. Infections that become resistant is a serious cases and sometimes, may even become impossible to treat.

My aim with this writing today is to focus on exploring the different existing infections, these infections that cause the sickness we read so much about, who are they, and what do they do?
An infection is said to have occurred when a microorganism finds its way into the human body and causes harm, the microorganism makes use of the infected body for its own sustenance, reproduction, and colonization.

After discussing cellular adaptation, Cellular Injury, and Cellular Damage, today I will be discussing cellular death. I said that our cells have the ability to adapt to a certain level of stress using mechanisms that can be hyperplasia, hypertrophy, or metaplasia, but when this stress becomes too much and the threshold of the cell is exceeded, cellular injury is experienced. This damage can be either in the reversible stage or in the irreversible stage. In the reversible stage, the cells can swell up as a result of sodium, potassium, and ATP pumps not functioning. If the stress is removed, reversible cell injuries can go back to a normal state. The irreversible damage is a result of cellular and membrane damage and this will lead to cell death.




The mophological hallmark of cell death is the loss of the cell's nucleus which is the main component of the cell. For the nucleus to die, it starts shrinking in size, a process known as pyknosis.

After discussing cellular adaptation in my last post, today, I will be doing Cellular injury in today's post. Let's get to it without any delay.

Cellular injury occurs as a result of a greater stress level compared to the adaptation level of the cell (threshold). These injury can be of different ranges depending on the type of Cells affected, the type of stress, and the severity of the stress. These cellular injuries can be caused by hypoxia, inflammation, genetic mutation, malnourishment, and trauma.

Hypoxia which is referred to as the inadequate supply of oxygen to a particular tissue in the body. Hypoxia occurs at the tissue level while Hypoxemia is low oxygen in the arteries, so If we are to define hypoxia simply, it is low oxygen delivery to tissues in the body. Oxygen is very important in tissues, as it is the final electron ","{""image"":[""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Apoptosisgif.gif"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apoptosisgif.gif""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemng"",""neoxian"",""stemgeeks"",""hive-engine"",""bee"",""waivio"",""cell"",""proofofbrain"",""stem""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.31-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[1.1237113402061856,0]}",2023-03-18 14:43:21,Cellular Injury and Cellular Damage,/hive-196387/@merrymercy/cellular-injury-and-cellular-damage,1

Metaplasia is a type of cellular adaptation where one differentiated cell type is replaced by another differentiated cell type. Cells undergo a lot of stress which could be as a result of their environment which could be toxic or have components that can possibly destroy the cells, but then the cells learn to adapt to overcome those stress to remain in shape. For instance, we know that our stomach is made up of HCL and this acid is very corrosive that it can eat up the lining of our stomach but then our stomach finds a way to adapt, so we do not have acids in our body which could lead to death.

Organs tend to regulate themselves so as not to cause damage to the cells and the organs themselves, but when these organs undergo stress, it could lead to after effects which includes growth of the organ. The changes that these organ can experience will be as a result of the severity and the type of stress that they are undergoing and this adaptation can be done through Hypothrophy or hyp","{""image"":[""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Hyperplasia_vs_Hypertrophy.svg"",""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hyperplasia_vs_Hypertrophy.svg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stem"",""stemng"",""stemgeeks"",""neoxian"",""waivio"",""bee"",""prooofbrain"",""cent"",""alive""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.31-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""image_ratios"":[0.8286384976525821,0]}",2023-03-15 19:32:15,"Cell Adaptation - Discussing Hypothrophy, Hyperplasia, Metaplasia, and Dysplasia",/hive-196387/@merrymercy/cell-adaptation-discussing-hypothrophy-hyperplasia,1

If you are in the medical world, either as a physician or as a medical student, or even random people who go about their daily lives, chances are that you might have come across an abused child. Today, let's address the issue of child abuse as it affects the health of a child as well as the psychology of such children. As a health practitioner, if you see a case of child abuse, it is important to report it to the appropriate authorities so they can look into it.

Child abuse can be in three ways, Physical, sexual, and emotional or psychological abuse. What is painful is that it is always inflicted by people who are close to the children such as caregivers, and parents. According to a paper by the Centers for Disease Control, 1 in 7 children in the US experience child abuse or neglect.

I actually passed that course with flying colors and it is in that spirit that I am going to be taking you through the Biology of Cell Theory.

When talking about cells, the year 1655 cannot be overruled. it was the year that the father of Cells, Robert Hooke took a thinly sliced cork under a crude microscope and found out it had cells that were honeycomb-like structures. The cells didn't have any nuclei in them but in 1674, Anton Van Leeuwenhoek observed the first living cell where he then noticed that they had nuclei. As the year went scientists continued to research cells and in 1850, Rudolf Virchow demonstrated that normal cells could become diseased cells in normal tissue. In 1855, he published his aphorism titled “omnis cellula e cellula” (“every cell stems from another cell"")

Did you know there was one disease that was a nightmare for children throughout the first half of the 20th century in the western world? That disease was Polio. People it didn't kill were left disabled with some crippled, confining them to wheelchairs for life, and others experiencing an inability to breathe, and it was affecting children and both parents and children had to face this nightmare. While today, the virus doesn't exist in the west it is still existing in some places and it is impressive that polio is almost eradicated, but it has left an effect and it is still leaving an effect. It was first observed in 1909 and it is the causative agent of Poliomyelitis, and I will be writing on Poliomyelitis which is shortened to Polio.

Two common psychiatric conditions in old people are depression and dementia. As people get older, there are higher prevalences of dementia, and some people would mistake it for depression. While both of them can co-exist, and people with dementia can be depressed, they aren't the same. In older people, depression is often missed and not treated because people really didn't find an older person sitting alone, confused, and not talking to be a possible sign of depression or dementia, some just see it as old age playing its thing. For an aged person of 80 years with a two-month history of social withdrawal, poor appetite with weight loss, self-neglect, chest infection, and confusion, this type of patient can be confused as a person with either depression or dementia.

While the scenario I gave above can be linked to both depression and dementia in old people, it is important to understand these two conditions one after the other.

Osteoarthritis of the knee is a degenerative joint disease  which affects the knee. It is typically the result of a progressive breakdown of the cartilages, thereby causing the bones of the knee to rub one another. If you want to be busy as an orthopedic surgeon, then you should focus on the knee as it is the most common type of arthritis being diagnosed. It is important to know that the bones that form joints are surrounded by periosteum which have pain receptors in them. The bones in the joints of the knee are surrounded by articular cartilages which absorb shock and enable the movement of the joint. The synovial membrane surrounds the articular cartilage and it produces the synovial fluid. Both the synovial membrane and the fibrous capsule makes up the articular capsule. The joints are stabilized by ligaments which helps to stabilize the joint. In the knee joint, a fibro-cartilages that supports movement, stabilizes the joint and absorb shock is known as meniscus.

I received a call that my mum had dislocated her legs. It was not a funny call to receive since I am not at home. She was immediately rushed to the hospital and was treated. She wanted me to travel down to see her but then it would take me about 9 to 11 hours to move from Abuja to Lagos. I had actually wanted to embark on the journey, but I thought about so many things including the state of security in the north and just thought it was a good idea I stayed back and communicate with her though phone. I wasn't happy I was not able to go down to see her but at knowing that she was fine brought me joy. That said, today I will be writing on dislocation, its causes, diagnosis and treatment. Someone will say, I thought you just reduce dislocations, yes we do, but there are cases where other options are considered.

Hello everyone, still on Microbiology and bacteriology, I will be discussing today the foundation of bacteriology which has to do with the structure and function of Bacteria components. Let's continue without wasting any time at all. Remember that I said that the study of Bacteria is Bacteriology and the study of microorganisms is microbiology.


I am sure you must have heard of the definition where Bacteria are described as microscopic, single-celled organisms that exist both inside and outside organisms. Bacteria are made up of appendages, attached to its cell which helps them achieve whatever their daily activities. These appendages include the Flagella, fimbriae, and Pilus. Bacteria are covered by the cell envelope which has multiple layers and encloses the endospore of the bacteria. In bacteria, there are components that include the Ribosome, the bacteria chromosome, and the plasmid. Bacteria do not have a nucleus, they possess nucleoids.

This means that streptococcus cannot catalyze hydrogen peroxide to give water and oxygen. While staphylococcus is arranged in clusters, streptococcus is arranged in chains.

I guess you remember? Today, I will be discussing Alcohol and alcohol intoxication. Alcohol intoxication occurs when a person has consumed a sufficient amount of alcohol beyond their limit to cause a range of physical and cognitive effects. Alcohol intoxication leads to Stupor (a state of reduced consciousness or responsiveness to external stimuli. Characterized by a diminished level of awareness and decreased ability to respond to their environment), Ataxia (a neurological condition characterized by lack of coordination and balance, caused by damage to the cerebellum or other parts of the nervous system responsible for controlling movement), and Slurred speech.

The foregut is the region of the digestive system that is made up of organs from the mouth to the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine, and the celiac trunk (celiac artery) is the major artery that supplies blood to the foregut. In this post, we are going be discussing the Celiac trunk/artery, explaining its origin, its location, and the region it supplies. In simple terms, I will be explaining the anatomy of the Celiac artery.

The celiac trunk originates from the abdominal aorta in the twelfth thoracic vertebra (T12) and L1 in the human spine, which supplies blood to the abdomen, and the abdominal viscera. The trunk then splits into three further arteries which are the **Common Hepatic Artery**, the **Left gastric Artery**, and the **Splenic Artery**. Also, the **Inferior Phrenic Artery** which supplies the diaphragm can arise from the Celiac trunk or from the abdominal trunk above the Celiac artery.

When it comes to reproduction in humans, Erection is very important. I do not think I have to Apologize for the type of words I might be using, since I am writing a science-oriented post, but if you need an apology for using words like Erection, then I sincerely apologize.  As I said before, an Erection is very important for sexual reproduction to occur, but when there is a topic on erection, people usually focus on the male erection and it is no doubt that people would talk about it since it is very noticeable but today, I will be focusing on the female erectile tissue.

The skin is made up of a few glands that secrete different things that helps us maintain moist. These glands perform different functions in the body, and they include the Sweat glands, Sebaceous glands, Ceruminous glands, Mammary glands, and Holocrine glands.


The **Ceruminous glands** are found in the ear canal and it produces earwax which protects the ear from dirt, dust, and other foreign substances that want to enter the ear. The **Sebaceous glands** produce Sebum which is the oily substance on the skin which helps keep the scalp, face, chest, hair, and other parts of the skin oily, and moisturized. In this post, we are looking at the Sweat gland and everything Sweat. The **Sweat Gland** is made up of the apocrine glands, apoeccrine glands, and eccrine glands. These glands produce different types of sweat and are activated by different stimuli.

Did you remember the first time you rode a bicycle? You were very cautious and didn't want to fall. Your brain was monitoring everything you had to needed to do to be safe with the exercise. This same thing applies to running, jumping, and doing everything exercise. Your brain is very cautious to ensure that you are not going to hurt yourselves but over time, you start to do these things without paying much attention to them and you also begin to love them as you do them that you could feel very comfortable with doing the muscle-related activity without worrying. How do skeletal muscles and the brain sync?

Let me quickly do a very simple explanation about skeletal muscles before we continue. Skeletal muscles are muscles that are voluntary and are attached to the bones of the skeleton. They are responsible for moving the skeleton. They are called striated muscles (skeletal and cardiac muscles) due to their stripped appearance under a microscope.

While our immune system is designed to defend the body against infections and diseases, by recognizing them (bacteria, viruses, and pathogens) as foreign, there are cases where the immune system could start to target tissue or another part of the body as foreign. This is the case of autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are conditions where the immune system mistakenly attacks its own cell, tissues, or organs, treating them as foreign to the body. This attack could lead to inflammation and damage of the tissue, cell, or organ, as well as cause other health problems. While it is not common, there are over 80 different autoimmune diseases which range from Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and Sjogren's syndrome. In today's post, I will be writing about Sjogren's syndrome.

There are numerous diseases, and infections that affect humans, while we are conversant with so many common diseases, infections, and deficiencies, some of them are very scarce that we might only hear or see them rarely. Today, I will be discussing **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** but for the purpose of this post, I will be referring to it as **Lupus**, since it is the most common type of Lupus.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune condition involving multi-system inflammation as a result of the immune system attacking its own tissues and organs, damaging them. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus can affect the blood vessel, joints, brain, skin, and lungs. The Etiology of Lupus is unknown, so we cannot say if it is caused by a pathogen or an infection. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus involves the production of autoantibodies causing immune complexes which are deposited in different areas of the body.

So many things have changed, and things are not the way they used to be, for some of these changes we are excited and happy, and for others, we wish they they never happened. Tuberculosis was more serious before, it was one condition that made families avoid their loved ones for the fear of spreading it, one of the good things that medical advancement and improvement have given to us is the prevention and cure of tuberculosis. Considering the high level of infection spread, it is unavoidable to find the rate of stigmatization to be a very high one.

Tuberculosis is a strong infectious disease affecting the lungs, the disease is a popular one as [WHO] records that, around 1.5 million people died from the infection in 2020, it also stands to be the 13th most common global death recorded, it is so popular that after covid-19, it is recorded to be the second most infectious cause of death.

Cancer is one disease that people are really scared of, in fact, to a lot of people it is a death sentence (to a lot of people and not everyone) but, how won't it look like a death sentence when its treatment can be very painful in most cases,  life-threatening, and expensive. I remember a friend's father who was undergoing chemotherapy which was very expensive in a country where people do not have insurance, and he was in pain as well. He didn't survive it actually, and since, my friend has been scared (real scared) when it comes to Cancer. In my post today, I will be sharing about cervical cancer, its pathophysiology, risk factor, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

As a child, my mum was always very concerned about me not having diarrhoea. This was because there was an outbreak of diarrhoea in our neighbourhood, which affected children who consumed public water and caused an epidemic. My mum was very scared and didn't want me to get diarrhoea, she was scared to even when the entire diarrhoea issue went down. Whenever I remember how paranoid she was about the diarrhoea  outbreak in the community and I laugh, although it is understandable. Today, I will be creating a post on Diarrhoea, its cause, and its treatment.


Diarrhoea can be said to be an increase in bowel movement, with a decrease in the consistency of the stool, causing it to be watery. It is important to know that the normal water content of a stool is approximately 10mL/kg/day in children and about 200g/day in adults, with diarrhoea, the water augmentation is imbalanced. Diarrhoea can also be regarded as a situation accompanied by 3 or more bowel movements (liquid stool) in a day","{""links"":[""https://www.flickr.com/photos/unicefethiopia/30663031201"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448082/"",""https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/diarrhoea"",""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158634"",""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diarrhoeal-disease"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148607/"",""https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2014/0201/p180.html"",""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544337/"",""https://gut.bmj.com/content/67/8/1380""],""image"":[""https://live.staticflickr.com/5550/30663031201_8dd9af8be8_b.jpg""],""thumbnails"":[""https://live.staticflickr.com/5550/30663031201_8dd9af8be8_b.jpg""],""tags"":[""hive-196387"",""stemsocial"",""stem"",""neoxian"",""biology"",""stemgeeks"",""stemgeek"",""ocd"",""gem"",""health""],""description"":"""",""app"":""ecency/3.0.29-vision"",""format"":""markdown+html""}",2022-11-20 22:16:12,Understanding Chronic and Acute Diarrhoea,/hive-196387/@merrymercy/understanding-chronic-and-acute-diarrhoea,9

You must have heard about **Kidney Stones**, but do not tell me that you really believe in the myth that kidney stones occur as a result of swallowing stones. I was talking to a friend, and he narrated how his grandmother who never had a first-time experience with kidney stones dished him the kidney stones myth. He said she told him that for every stone or sand, no matter how little you swallow, there is a small amount that isn't digested by your stomach, and might not be excreted with faecal matter, thereby living the only option to be that the stone goes into the blood, then to the kidney where it starts to block the kidney region. When I heard this, I was dazed. I tried to wrap my head around what could have led brought to life such a story or belief. Well, I am not his grandmother, and I am not going to be telling you myths that I cannot fact-check.

In school, there were certain classes that I would spend hours  in and those classes were boring. I would fall asleep during this classes but at the same time, I would try really hard to see that I do not fall asleep. There were times when I would have to pinch myself hard, and just find something doing. In most cases, I am always able to control my sleep-wake cycle at that point. This also happens to people at place of worships especially during times of sermons and teachings. A friend told me that there were times when he would fall asleep in church but immediately he gained consciousness, he would ensure that he doesn't fall asleep again, a process that helps him regulate his sleep - wake cycle. In this post I will be looking into a sleeping disorder known as **Narcolepsy**.

Hey everyone, It is a good time to be here today. Thanks a lot for everyone who finds time to read through my post, and for everyone who leave a comment, it means a lot to me. In today's post, I will be looking into breathing and the mechanism of breathing. We all know that breathing is important for our living, as we exchange oxygen and carbon(iv)oxide which we breathe. Study shows that humans cannot stay above 4 minutes or so, without oxygen before Permanent brain damage begins. How does the process of breathing goes in the body, what is the mechanism of breathing. Take a deep breath and let us enjoy the breathtaking (I mean breath giving) post.

Have you ever witnessed an obsessive person before? Obsession is real and a lot of people are a victim to the condition. It is one thing to be in love, and it is another thing to be obsessed, but before we get into details on obsessive disorders, let's talk about the existing difference between love and obsession.

A healthy relationship is one that gives room for appropriate space when necessary, but when you are being engrossed, or consumed with someone who never wants you out of their sight, not even for the purpose of a job or anything, may be showing a sign of obsession. An obsessive person shows clear signs of being controlling, defensive and even act in a resentful way sometimes.

Have you ever been caught in a situation where you hear a word that ends with the surfix -phobia, and you do not know what it means or even had an idea such a word existed? Oh! I guess you must have been caught in such a situation. You know, you start to wonder why does this person enjoy saying the blah blah - phobia, instead of just saying the meaning straight up? You see, it is quite easy to say something like **Aquaphobia**, instead of going on to say **The fear of Water**. C'mon, one is convenient, while the other is just a long train. I will help do justice to the phobia thing, and let you in on a list of phobias that you weren't even certain existed. Let me state clearly that phobia is a medical term used by medical practitioners (doctors and psychiatrist) but we now use them in our day-to-day lives and in almost all conversations.

The enlargement and stiffening of the penis. This is the literal definition of erection. It is important that I let you know that both male and female experience similar form of erection, since the female have clitoris erection, but today, I am focusing on the male side of erection.

The penis is the reproductive organ for both urine and semen. The brain is responsible for erection psychologically, resulting from sensory inputs such as visuals, auditory, olfactory, and imaginary. What you see, what you hear, what you smell, and what you imagine will send a signal to the brain which then sends messages to the blood vessels of the Penis. One of the most sensitive part of the male genital organ, responsible for erection, is the distal end of the Penis (Gland's Penis). The Gland's penis has lots of nerve endings, which sends signal to the lower part of the spinal cord (Sacral Vertebrae) through the pudendal nerve, and then to the brain.

Sugar, one very controversial topic that I must say has gotten a lot of us worried. You might have heard about people saying it is bad, causing sweet tooth, diabetes, obesity, and so on. In this post, sugar and how health is what we are going to be looking at. Is sugar good or bad?

If we are going to do a little history, then it should be clear that humans have been consuming sugar for a very long time from natural foods, and fruits (especially carbohydrate foods). The story of human extracting crystalline sugar became a thing in South East Asia. It should be understood that the early man has been consuming sugar from food they got from hunting and gathering foods, fruits, and vegetable. Sugar has become a part of our lives, and we cannot even live a day without consuming sugar.

If you go to the farm regularly, or have a part of your house which predominantly has loamy soil, then you should be abreast with Earthworms. Also, if you go for fishing with your grandpa, and he loves to bait fishes, then you must have seen earthworms. Earthworms when looking from a distance looks very simple, far from complex, and you start to wonder if there is anything fascinating about it, but Earthworms are more than just those farm worms you see or just fish bait, there are a lot of things you should know about earthworm, and I will be looking at the Morphology, and Anatomy of Earthworms in this post.

#### <center>Taxonomy of Earthworm</center>
You see, earthworm, is a general name for over 7000 species of the organisms that falls under the phylum **Annelida**, and the common genus of earthworm we know, is the Genus **Lumbricus** which has over 300 species. So when you see an earthworm, be certain that it is either one of the 7000 species that exist.</div>

Today, I was outside my house when I saw a snail, and I decided to understand the anatomy of this very small and slow creature. It is important to know that this small creature is responsible (directly or indirectly) for the transmission of diseases to humans. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Diseases such as Schistosomiasis, which is caused by Blood Flukes (trematode worm), is released by freshwater snails which kills about 200,000 people yearly. Other snail-borne parasitic diseases includes, angiostrongyliasis, clonorchiasis, fasciolopsiasis, opisthorchiasis paragonimiasis, amongst others which causes diseases in humans. Today, I am not discussing the diseases caused by snails, I want to look into snails anatomy.

Water is an essential part of life, we cannot exist without the use of water and certainly, everyone likes water but there are certain scientific sides to water that are not unveiled to a layman.

It is not a new thing that, financial literacy/education is not a particular topic taught in educational systems, learning about finance from parents as well, is highly dependent on the type of family we come from, so if we want to learn about handling our finance appropriately, we will have to go about that business in another way. Learning and unlearning on a daily basis about how well to handle our finance is a great addition.

I have heard about different food allergies, I am allergic to some myself too, but I never knew that milk allergy was really so much of a big deal until recently when I meet a new friend who said she doesn't take milk. I thought everyone loved milk so believe me when I said I was really shocked when she said she was allergic to milk. 

Allergy to milk is a reaction of the immune system to milk, not only milk but even other milk products. Milk allergy is common in children, it is in fact one of the most common allergies that children have but it happens to adults also. Cow milk is often the main reason behind milk allergy, although milk from goats, buffalo, sheep, and other mammals can also cause allergy too.

Milk reaction could either be mild or severe. Basically avoiding milk and products of milk is the first and most common treatment for milk allergy, but if milk allergy occurs in children, it could actually be outgrown.

### What exactly is Pulmonary Hypertension?

Pulmonary hypertension is actually a type of high blood pressure, this high blood pressure affects the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary arteries are blood vessels that carry blood (oxygen-poor) from the heart to the lungs. 

Pulmonary hypertension is actually really dangerous, it actually disrupts the flow of blood through the heart and lungs, it causes the arteries to become narrow, therefore, giving the heart more work by making it pump oxygen-poor blood into the lungs. The extra effort taken to pump the blood eventually makes the heart muscle weak and of course, fails in the long run.
