I couldn't believe my best friend did all this. I tried getting to Darasimi but his phone was switched off. I decided to check him in his house only for me to realise that he wasn't at home. 

Then I eventually went to James house, where James told me he has been there since the night before.

I met Darasimi in a bar drinking himself to stupor. He glanced up and saw me, he looked scared. I walked up to him and held him by the shoulder, he was shaking and almost freezing to death while sweating profusely.

“oh “she actually signed""
“you saw that” she had the audacity to asked.

“how could you Jane, I trusted you, how could you do such a thing?”
“look Mofe, to be honest with you,”

 Drasimi couldn’t resist me, and do you honestly think he is going to fall for you?. No offence girlfriend but do you even look yourself in the mirror?. There no way Dara will ever loves you with that body” 

I thought you are my friend” I said incredulously.
“it’s not my fault really , but what am I to do when a hot guy like Darasimi falls for me? Definitely am not to say no………just get over him, am  sure there are guys your level you chose from.

I couldn't get through to Jane to Inform her of my coming to school. I decided to leave for school early so as to be able to attend the 10:00 AM lectures I had that day. Rushing into the apartment, I had no reason to guess I would be confronted with a scene so heartbreaking. I saw Jane Sprawl over Darasimi's chest and both stark naked.

I couldn't believe my eyes, I thought I was actually dreaming but in truth, it was the reality. Hre is my best friend who am ready to pour out my whole family ordeal to and who has repeatedly shown open hatred for the man.

I rushed back out without either of them seeing me. I just needed to clear my head first. I decided to go back home in the evening and confront Janewith what I saw. On getting home, she was all smiling and pretended as if all was well. She was happy to see me (at least it was obvious she was pretending).

I got home and saw all my extended family members sitting and looking cold in our sitting room. I looked around and didn't see my Dad and Mom, and i got scared. 

""What is going on here, where is my dad and mom?"" I asked with a dreadful look. ""your dad is in the hospital Mofe, he had an heart attack and your mom is with him now, we didn't want to tell you in school so you would not hurt yourself. My Dad's younger brother said to me. 

My stay at home lasted for about a week before I started making plans to go back to school. My dad is out of harm's way but we all felt the impact in the house.

""Well, I think its a start of something and he even said he is not through with me so I hope that means something"" I replied her getting irritated with Jane's plain dislike for Darasimi.

""We will see, sha don't say I didn't warn you ooo. ehn ehn..."" she left the room angrily. Despite Jane's bitter words, I refused to let it destroy my mood.

The following morning, I received a call from my mom to come home that day. Lagos, just being two hours drive from my school, I decided to leave and return the same day, I placed a call to Dara and informed him i will be going home the said day. Jane also saw me off to the park.

""I want to feel your touch"" he whispered in my ears and brings his hand towards my neck. I heard my breathing increasing as he brought his lip less than an inch from mine. Then he lips less than an inch from mine. Then he dipped his head and the instant. 

""Stay with me tonight?"" he asked and that brought me back to my senses. ""I have to go,"" I said as I scurry around with my things. ""Am not through with you yet"" he shouted after my retreating back.

I couldn't keep the happy ecstasy off my face and my friend noticed right the minute I entered the house. I told her all that happened and immediately, she became angry.

""So because he kissed you now, you think he loves you? you are really stupid"" She said with plain irritation on her face.

""Uhm...uhm !""I became speechless after this and before I can find something to say he continued ""look, about us, I sincerly like you, even beyond like. ""I have this feeling inside me whenever i'm with you and I really wish you don't have this effect on me. I'm me whenever I'm with you and I think i'm getting attracted to you"".

That is it! I couldn't control my emotions, he felt something for me!

I tried opening my mouth to tell him how much I love him, to tell him to always stay me with me but I couldn't tell him. I was just too excited to talk.

He runs his hand along my arms and goose bums immediately raised on my skin.

""What am i to you Darasimi?"" I asked nervously after many attempts.

""I don't understand"" he replied not really paying attention to me, he was paying attention to the movie he was watching. ""Look, I'm not your type of girl, I'm not pretty, am dumb and not sociable but I really want us to define our relationship"".

""I know you are not pretty and you are plain but you are beautiful to someone just the way you are without editing or recreating another image. Don't regret how you look or your flaws because there is someone who will die for it"".

""I hope this your obsession with Darasimi will not land you in trouble moreover, the guy did not even ask you out, abi did he?"" Jane asked one evening on our way back from class.
""No he hasn't but I'm sure he will soon, I can feel his interest"" i replied her.

She snorted ""with your looks? I am sorry to say this, but More, I can't imagine a guy like Darasimi to be interested in you, it really cannot happen. i was devastated on hearing this but I tried not to let it show on my face.

 I was invited by Darasimi to his house and on getting there we chatted and we had a lot of gist as usual then we watched a movie together. Jane's word kept on running through my mind and I couldn't help but to ask Darasimi what he really thought of me.

Jane and I are from rich families too and we maintained our cool. Darasimi and I got close, we talked virtually about everything about he made me talked virtually about everything and he made me to understand how much he likes being with me. With him being rich and handsome, he never for once complained about my looks.

Everything was going on smoothly between us, we find time to hang out once in a while and I got to see James Darasimi's friend. We hadn't asked me out I had started seeing him as a boyfriend. 

Darasimi was a sweet young guy to be with.

""He is bad news for you Mofe"" Jane said 
""But what has this guy done to you now? remember he is my crush oo"" I said


""I've told you my own, sha don't come crying to me oo"" she said sounding angry but calm to an extent. What Jane said did not bother me at all, I couldn't let her words deter me, so I met Darasimi on a daily basis

From the look of things, I could tell Darasimi was from a wealthy home. He had everything he wanted at his disposal. He doesn't like an extravagant lifestyle and I kept wondering what it is about me that interest him a lot.

We finally got to the party and the music was numbingly loud with people too excited to see one another. Jane left me to find my way amongst the crowd there, which meant that she wanted me to go around and mingle with people.

She was mingling with her sociable friends and for once, I tried not to be awkward as I was trying all my possible best to be loosened and have fun but partying wasn't my way of catching fun. I had to find a seat for myself because I was tired of the entire partying life.As soon as I sat, I heard a slightly thick baritone voice saying ""Hello pretty"", I was shocked at first but tried to Comport myself ""Um... Uh.... Hmm... Hi"" I could mutter something out finally although I was nervous.

We chatted for sometime and exchanged phone numbers before he left, promising to call me. We left the party around mid-morning.

Jane was indifferent and said she couldn't see what was so good and special about Dara. The following week, Jane was invited to a birthday party and Jane being Jane, tried to get me on the motion to the party.

""Jane, you know I don't like going out much""

""You need to go, moreover you can't be all alone in the house doing nothing"". Jane finally got me dolled up and dragged to the party like a one-year-old baby. We had a lot of bargain so I would not go, but my criminal mind friend already had her mind crossed at kidnapping me to the party consciously.

She told me this was for this best coupled with the fact that there are more parties to attend. Admittedly, I wasn't very social but actually I enjoyed my introvert life and personallity.

Darasimi stone was inarguably the most guy I figured I'd ever know and yes, he was my crush too. The only person who knows about this is my Jane.



""Am seeing you again?"" James said on sighting me, ""yes"" I replied.

""Well, this is Darasimi my friend, Darasimi, this is Mofe"".

""Nice name, suits you,"" Dara said holding out his hand for a handshake.

""Hmmm, thanks"" I replied, shaking his hand. ""Well"" I said for a while feeling on top of the world ""I will see you around"" I said. I couldn't control my excitment as I raced home to gist Jane about today.

""Mofe, you really should go out more often and free yourself, you need to see what is in vogue, anyways I'm off"" Jane left me at the house with these final words. 

I decided to take a bath and headed to the campus. I was already late for my classes and to do a lot of running along, I bumped into someone, gently apologised and was about going when he spoke up ""Easy girl"" he said and gripped my hands firmly. I immediately apologised again ""Oh sorry, I'm so sorry"", he replied me with a less hard voice ""it's okay, my name is James by the way"" I told him mine and made him understood that I had to go as I tried to disentangle myself.

Since I have been a child, I love reading a lot, I have little almost no friends, i bearly hung out with either of the sexes male or female. I keep to myself a lot which makes me a little unique.

""How's things?"" Jane, my friend asked. Jane has been my friend since i was in my 100 level, we have been friends now for about three years. We met when I gained admission into the university. We were roommates and soon flatmates. ""How's things?"" She asked one more time holding up a cloth for me to see.

The gift doesn't really matter as much as the heart that gives the gift. I got a very big gift from a friend of mine who showed how much he loves me. 

I was dumbfounded when he showed me the lovely present with the tag ""To my best friend"". I felt so special and loved. I could not express myself more than I had expressed. Never look down on gifts as things are not up to standard no matter how big or small it may be. Love is what makes the gift adorable, and beautiful. Nothing else beats love and I love Love itself.

Cherish gifts, adore gifts, make the giver feel special and shower love on the giver. Gifts doesn't neccessarily mean that the giver wants something in return, it is only a way to show his love.

I was introduced to this platform by a kind, gentle and simple steemian @oluwatobiloba, I call her Aunty Tobi because she is one big sister I never had.
She is the best sister and confidant one can ever have, when I tell my friends that she is not my blood sister, they are usually amazed because she has taken me to be her own.
The most shocking aspect is that we are not even related by blood, we are just family friends but she has become a big sister and a role model to many of us.

They have different love language, Love touch, and ways at which they view love.  The way ladies react to things is quite different from the way guys react to things and what ladies take so important aren't regarded when it comes to the masculine gender. They are always straightforward, goal pursuing and purpose driving. Ladies, on the other hand, are affectionate, so fragile and emotional.
