A good entrepreneur is really concerned about growing his or her business and at the point when there is growth there is going to be a need to get a business partner, now partnering in business is absolutely essential but the progress or the destruction of the business is also highly related to the partnership option made available. Partnership is an extremely serious step in business that must be considered carefully.

Business partnership is very serious and every hands needs to be on deck in order for the business to succeed. Every member of the business has a strategic role to play and if there is a loss end at one side of the deal then it may just result in the business failing seriously.

#### The discipline of the mind.
The mind is a very strong and serious controller of our lives our mind has so much to do with the occurrence around us, it is either we allow our mind to lead us to positive and great things or we allow our mind to push us very far away from the success we want to attain. Once we are able to get our minds disciplined, it becomes pretty easy for us to get along with other things.

As simple and as common as this statement may appear, I want you to take a moment and have deep reflection over it, look within yourself and ask yourself if you really know what it is  that you want from life. Day in day out there are so many tasks to be fulfilled and we run around those tasks without even knowing what we want from life, as we run around every day trying to survive we need to ask ourselves a very sincere question- am I in charge of the direction of my life?

You want to be certain that you are living your life in a way that you are proud of and you are not just living your life to please somebody else. When you are sure of whom you are and what your drive is in life, it will be difficult for a negative relationship to sweep you off your feet.  Without a reason to live and a plan to move with, it will be very easy for you to get into toxic relationships that will shift you off focus for a long time.

have you noticed that in your 20s, you wanted the best of all things. Okay, let me make it a little understandable, in your 20s, you want the finest of all things which had a normal or regular values. For instance, in your 20s, you wanted to follow the trend and buy the most expensive accessories, cloths and so on, neglecting the fact that both the regular and the luxury serve the same purpose just that one is more pleasant to the eyes to the other. This things take a lot of money from you and at the end, you are left with little or no money with you .

Although no business in entirely stress-free but a few businesses demand more time and effort and even disrupt your daily activities. A few of these businesses aren’t even going to become a big corporation but they can be tasking as it could be done by only on person or a few people. A good example is an event planning business where people have to work round the clock to make an event look at its best even when the event owners aren’t willing to pay for the fantasies they want. There are several times a client will call for a change in plans or style and as an event planner, you just have to do it. In most cases, as an event planner, you are either spending a little out of budget or you are stressed out.

* The second way is to, face the conversation and handle it appropriately.
* The third one is to, face the conversation and end up with a terrible result in handling them.

Reading biographies of billionaire entrepreneurs or watching an interview about their stories can be very interesting which often want to give you a reason to become an entrepreneur as well. Maybe you aren’t always listening to the success stories, maybe they discuss a few things about how the business started and they had to handle a few challenges and overcome. You know what, success stories are always interesting because the hard work and challenge stories can’t be said deeply.

However, some under developed nations are still blind to technological improvement, I once read that there are countries that do not make use of mobile phones and who still walk around without clothes, so while we have children who grew up in a civilized world filled with machineries, there are children who grew up in villages and will jump up with excitement at the sight of electricity.


Before we continue, I will give brief explanations on what technology is about.

However, for the purpose of this post, we will be talking about the dream that involves sleeping, you know that stuff that occurs whenever you go to bed and you find yourself doing other things ( I mean being active in the other life).

There have been lots of religious interpretations to the reason why people find themselves active in another realm while they appear to be sleeping in this realm, but in this post we will be taking a sneak peak at the psychological aspect of dreams, what do psychologist have to say about dream?
