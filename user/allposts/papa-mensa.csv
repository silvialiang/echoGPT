They can determine which company will go bankrupt next with their power. They have access to billionaire and millionaire investors funds and can determine the day a company will declare a page 13 bankruptcy because they have access to PR people, Private investigators, while they make money over the loss of the companies.

Yes, entering data for businesses and government agency is a very good way to start earning a living from home, automated machines do not always do this job well and so humans are needed.

Kmart started in the 80s by Sebastian Kresge in Detroit. The store was able to overcome the test of time from the world war to the great depression. Kresge mart became a place for shopper to shop and keep money and it increased in sales and started having more locations.

In the 1980s, Kmart had over 2000 stores in the US and in Canada. Kmart had a kitchen line, a clothing line and it acquired a lot of other company. Their sales grew to over 26 bill","{""tags"":[""business"",""kmart"",""bankruptcy"",""leofinance""],""image"":[""https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kmart-1024x682.jpg""],""links"":[""https://images.app.goo.gl/Vi9sTcJ9D8eEE49E6""],""app"":""hiveblog/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2020-12-30 08:13:30,Kmart; the Mart that Closed almost all its Stores,/hive-175254/@papa-mensa/kmart-the-mart-that-closed-almost-all-its-stores,1

Well, I am not here to discuss who should have won and who should lose as the election is suppose to be the people's voice and although, there are lawsuits against the election, Joe Biden is regarded as the 46th president in the history of America.

Do not forget that when during Trumps tenure which isn't over yet, there were a lot of policies made and if Biden eventually wins the court hearings and becomes the 46th president of the United States, he would also be bringing out a few policies.

A person could trade milk for meat and so on. I do not think civilization met barter because barter only works with people a very small amount of people who need the same goods but when needs begin to differ and the population begin to increase thereby having several options, it becomes difficult to trade because the goods intended to be traded with another party might not be needed at the time and so the Barter system become not appropriate for such trade. Asides barter, there need to be something of value that would be needed to sign trades, and that is where money came into being.

I like to learn about history a little bit so I did a little research to learn about how this issue of recession came into the picture in the first place, but before then I will like to know what recession is about: Recession occurs when there is a difference in the level of supply as well as demand.


>In economics, a recession is a business cycle contraction when there is a general decline in economic activity. Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending (an adverse demand shock).

#### It is possible for money to grow on trees.
 We are all used to hearing that money does not grow on trees but I just found out that it is possible to have money grow on trees, but I am not referring to just a physical tree though. A tree that will produce money is a tree that has been nurtured and has become self-sustainable to produce lifelong leaves. This may be in form of investment or starting a trade that you will properly watch over until it gives us the type of result that we want.

Nokia didn’t start as a phone company, it started as a paper mill. This paper mill was going real well and soon Frederik partnered with Leo Mechelin who was also running paper mills in Finland. Their partnership gave birth to a public company called Nokia AB. Soon, this company started utilizing the Nokianvirtia River to generate electricity which became a new venture for the company. The company was now into paper milling and electricity production but it wasn’t going to end there. Soon the company was failing after the First World War had got bailed out when Eduard Polon who owned Finnish Rubber workss bought the company.

Some people say brand cannot exist without the business and the business is the brand (This doesn’t go with brand like Versace when Michael Kors holding bought all outstanding shares in Gianni Versace S.r.l, in 2018, the brand name did not change but the company changed ownership).

Louis Pasteur said “Chance favors the prepared mind”, there are certain preparations to be done before starting a business and one of it is writing a business plan. When a business has a writing plan, it shows how feasible the business is, it shows investors and customers what the company want to achieve and it serves as a yardstick for the business owners or team to measure reality in the business.

There are also a lot of people who really want to make moves in a silent way but do not know how they can do that, announcing your success before it arrives has a lot of downsides attached to it.
