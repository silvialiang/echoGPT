In society now a days,when some people are facing difficulties instead of finding solution to the problem, they began to look for short cut.. 
I want you to note  that every short cut in life will definitely cut life short..

 This occur mostly in Africa, when some People passing through hardship instead of finding a way to the problem, they began to look for short cut by killing innocent people for money ritual...
This process of money ritual bring a lot of fear to people because there is no one to trust.
especially the youth, they're  very desperate to make money,they can do and undo just to make money..
