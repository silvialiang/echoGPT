I never knew there was a platform that rewarded people for creating contents since I am conversant with medium and reddit, but I do not get rewards for writng except that I gain a lot from reading posts from others as well as writing post. Reading and writing is part of me so majority of my time goes there but on weekends, I always spend my time farming.

### Simple Definition
Definitely, Investors are people who believe in your ideas, plans, goals and designs and have decided to put in their funds to make your ideas become reality. They expect returns for their money and in most cases they lose their money if the company goes bankrupt.

Employees are the ones who have to sacrifice their time, ","{""tags"":[""business"",""customer"",""investor"",""employee"",""steemleo"",""steem-leo""],""image"":[""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmabiayorh8XntmkG82fs3cnFnjQirx9zEbrs9dakG5Wj7/960x0%20(1).jpg"",""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmb9c6KP59eqHCaVrgAyY5Qq4btgNQhnLcUMuFeRc5fXYR/2015-09-June-Generations.jpg""],""links"":[""https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/12/14/who-is-more-important-to-a-company-its-customers-or-its-employees/amp/"",""https://www.cmswire.com/social-business/creating-employees-for-life/""],""app"":""steemit/0.2"",""format"":""markdown""}",2020-02-25 08:14:18,"The Investors, The Employees, The Customers; Who is more Important to a Business?",/hive-175254/@frederickbangs/the-investors-the-employees-the-customers-who-is-more-important-to-a-business,19
frederickbangs,utilizing-advertisement-properly-in-business,Utilizing Advertisement properly in Business,hive-175254,"Having a business without advertising is a business that isn’t prepared to grow. Advertising is vital for the success of a business, because it is the basic way new and old customers learn you are out there. Most times, I am amazed at the way entrepreneurs believe that their businesses as big as it might seem or as amazing as the idea might be will get people to line in front of their business centers without adverts. If you start a business in a complex with no advert at all, it will be regarded as a new home that a family just acquired instead of a business, so nobody will be coming to knock at the door of your business. Marketing from bill boards, customer services, word of mouth, television and internet advert, networking and promotion is very important is the route with potentially the biggest payoff.

Earning is something we all want to do, the more we earn is the more we get to enjoy the basic necessities of life. Earning more is what most of us are always concerned about (I really don’t know why anyone would not like to earn more anyways), there are some skills that are usually noticed amongst those who are great giants in earning more money and some of those skills I will definitely be talking about through this post.

### A good sales skill.
Being able to sell is not limited to sales people alone, at some point in life there will be the need to sell ourselves as well as the product we are offering. Getting a reputable job demands that we are able to sell ourselves very well to the management of the establishment.

The question of why Africa remains poor has long been a topic of debate and discussion even when the continent has vast natural resources and potential for growth.  Many African countries continue to struggle with poverty, economic inequality, and social instability. In this post, I will look into some of the reasons why Africans are poor.

The first thing I will discuss is corruption. Corruption is a major problem in many African countries, with government officials and business leaders siphoning off public funds for personal gains and riches. Corruption hinders economic growth and development by diverting resources away from essential services like healthcare, infrastructure, and education. You start to wonder where politicians' children who do not have any current job description are able to buy houses worth millions of dollars in the US, UK, and other foreign countries.

Titi is a young Nigerian woman who was able to take advantage of the recent bull market in Dogecoin, thanks to her participation in an ajo group. Titi is a savvy saver who has been part of an ajo group for several years. Each month, she contributes a set amount of money to the group, and in turn, receives a lump sum of money when it's her turn to receive the funds. As a shrewd investor, Titi had been keeping an eye on the cryptocurrency market and saw an opportunity to invest in Dogecoin when it was still relatively unknown. She decided to use her ajo savings to purchase a small amount of Dogecoin, hoping to see it grow in value over time. Over the following months, Titi watched as the value of her Dogecoin investment steadily increased, eventually reaching a new all-time high during the recent bull market.

Generation Z, born between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s, is the first generation to grow up in a fully digital world. In Africa, where the youth population is the largest in the world, Gen Zers are facing unique financial challenges that threaten their financial well-being.

According to a recent report by the African Development Bank, African youth have poor financial literacy, low access to financial services, and limited opportunities for entrepreneurship. These factors contribute to the poor financial life of African Gen Zers.

One of the major issues that African Gen Zers face is a lack of financial education. Most of them do not receive any formal financial education in schools, and their parents may not have the knowledge or resources to teach them about money management. As a result, many African Gen Zers lack basic financial skills, such as budgeting, saving, and investing.

Investing is an important part of building wealth over time by starting early and starting early can have a big impact on our financial future. In Africa, there are many investment options available to young people that can help them grow their money and secure their financial futures even though it looks impossible. Africa is regarded as the financial hub of the future, and all you need to do is tap into the continent's resources.

The word ""fake it till you make it"" is very common in Nigeria, especially in Lagos. Living a fake life is a very detrimental act to the personality, values, and authenticity of a person. It also has a negative impact on finances. Lagos is a city that is known for its vibrant and fast-paced lifestyle, in fact, we say that it is a city that never sleeps. There are many young people aspiring to live a life of luxury and comfort even when they cannot live such a life now. However, while they try to be comfortable, they still make a lot of mistakes, and one of such mistakes so living a fake life. It is important to note that there is a thin line between living a comfortable life and living a fake life.

Every human has a reticular activating system and this activating system has the tendency to stay glued to the particular believe you have and will not allow any other thing to come in there, every human has this side in their lives and it is left to them to make the decisions on what they will permit into their lives. 

This reticular activating system is pushed to function based on the things we feed our minds with, if we continue to feed our minds with the information that we are unloved, it is only normal that this activated sense in us continues to feel that way and make the mind function likewise, if we always activate the feeling of being loved then it is normal that this reticular activating system will continue to make you feel loved.

>>This morning I will like to talk to you my friends about finding time to rest as an entrepreneur, sometime last year I made a decision to take a day in the week off work, that day is for religious activities and for rest as well and I am glad I made that decision, for everyone I employ as well I always give them that day off in in order for them to rest.

You will agree with me that some existing businesses will want to make you patronize them while some other business names will just be a complete turn off. In a business, a business name has to be highly regarded and considered, while putting other things into consideration when you want to start a business, a business name should be one of the priorities.

Although this post is not only for the festive periods alone, it is to correct certain spending errors all through the year but it is also very important to learn now that there is a higher tendency to even spend.

The people who do deals on a regular basis, time in and time out on the stock market are not investors, but traders they are market makers and they are responsible for the day to day changes on the market.

Some people will not agree with this, while some will slightly agree because of the person who said so but the truth is, it is possible. Retirement is the period a lot of people look forward to as they spend most of their active years working and they hope one day, they will have to retire from working and just relax on their rock chair all day with millions in their account, but this often end up the other way round as most people often retire broke and those who have something to fall back on actually fall back on their 401k.

Well, if you don’t, then you are putting yourself at the risk of going to get a loan when things are down and one negative side of loans is that they are triggered by impulses which often come as a result of no other option to take and this loans can go as high as 10% to 40% in return. This is what you get when you do not have any savings. Why do people not have cash saved up for days of emergencies? The answer is how they spend money.

What is the rule of 72, do people need 72 rules to get their investment profit value in the future? In this post, I will be talking about the **Rule of 72**.


![rule of 72.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmXQamDs4ovxDY4mff6oYD2DcraTU5Ha5Y7XhHbyLhUAGV/rule%20of%2072.png)
[Source](https://www.thewealthyfinn.com/2019/08/the-rule-of-72.html)




**Compound Interest** is the continuous addition of interest in a capital over a period of time. At the point it becomes a rollover of both previous interest and capital to form a new interest thereby increasing the entire investment over a period. If a person invest $100 in a year and the interest rate is 10% to give $10 interest thereby making the investment grow to become $110, the interest for the next year will be calculated at $110 at 10% and not $100 which was the initial investment.

Making money is something great but sustaining generational wealth is where great task is. Unlike personal wealth, generational wealth is passed down and in most cases in form of assets which the offspring need to keep growing and improve on so as to pass to the next generation. While self-made millionaires and billionaires, lottery billionaires and millionaires can lose their wealth easily and still have to start from the scratch up, families with generational fortune must not lose their family wealth as it has become a legacy.

With hyperinflation, the money of a country gradually falls and loses value completely and at this point, the government starts to print trillions of the currency just to pay for simple things like pen. In countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe, inflation is on the hyper side and at this point, the country becomes very much of a joke and its economy isn’t taking seriously anymore.

Everyone has the power to manage and control their attitude it only takes a lot of willingness and deliberate effort to make that possible, a good attitude invested into a relationship with your client will help you get the best out of that relationship.


Emotionally, a lot of effort needs to be placed in our day to day attitude, we have to be able to control our emotions in a way that we do not get to hurt our clients even when we get into the worst mood ever, when we allow wrong emotions control us all the time it is definite that we are going to hurt our clients and definitely we will not get the best out of that relationship.

HE can now easily create emails, send and receive mails, prepare presentations as well as work on project proposals and so on from the comfort of his home, even when he is on holidays, leave, or on vacations.

Working at google in the early 90’s provided staff with an opportunity to work on any project they choose to work on during the time of service, it was during periods like this that Paul Buchheit who was also a staff at Google came up with the idea of Gmail. Gmail was given a trial because mails were seriously been used at that time and Gmail attracted their audience by offering more storage space than other available mail services.

What is Dropshipping? I will explain simply what Dropshipping is; it is the business of creating a website usually to sell products which does not exist in the inventory of the drop shippers but rather, the drop shippers buy their products from a vendor or store, mostly Alibaba, Ali Express, Orberlo and so on, to the customer at a little more expensive price, leaving the vendor or supplier to supply the goods/product to the customers without having to send the goods through the drop shipper.

Despite the fact that so many people desire money, most of us still make very silly mistakes with the little we get and we fail to realize that the little money we end up wasting today can actually accumulate into something desirable tomorrow.

Well, maybe not every country can become wealthy because there are some big political powers making huge benefit from the poor state of the country and the process of getting the country rich, is certainly going to deflate their pocket and that is one thing they never want to happen.

Gambling in the world of trading is shooting shots for short term profit from gambling activities. When a person starts to trade based on hoping for a rise or a fall just like predicting a football match, it is called gambling. Trading has more to do with analysis, ability to handle money.

There is no trading magic in the world of trading, when you believe that there is a magical trick to make a successful trading, then this is gambling. Trading requires personal feeding, and good positioning. A trader either the buyer or the seller has the believe that they are having a fair deal and they aim to make profit at the end of the day.

Starting production of every part of products from scratch to finish using machine and software. This wasn’t a thing in everyone’s lip some years back as traditional manufacturing was the very way to produce products from car manufacturing, rocket manufacturing, and building construction and so on.

When it comes to business, you should never get to a point where you feel too relaxed to think of something new and fresh. Even if your business appears to be doing well now, be rest assured that anything can happen at any time and always think about something to make your business appear fresher all the time. You might be surprised that I am using the word fresh, but as much as you want your body to appear young and fresh that same energy should be used in your business also if you want to make it appear attractive to customers.

In his words, he made it clear that we might be entering a period where people who invested in the stock market will not make profit until the year 2030. Ray Dalio isn’t a baby investor, he is a billionaire hedge fund manager and a notable voice in the world of investing but this time, he is very skeptical about investing for profit in the next 10 years.  This is not the first time such would occur so it shouldn’t look like something impossible. Investing before the dotcom bubble crash is a very good example, it took internet companies about 12 years to make profit. Also in 1929, something similar happened when if you invested money in the stock market, it took 30 years to make profit.

Although, a lot of people and companies have been seeing high level of setbacks and loss but even in this pandemic, there seem to be a few companies and sectors hitting it hard and winning. In this post, I will be writing about a few companies and industries still doing well;

### The Online streaming Platform
Disney plus, Netflix, YouTube, HBO and many more have left the weekend routine of watch to the everyday routine of watch as families want to enjoy movies and keep the fun going. Disney plus is what have saved the Disney empire as Disney parks were shut down, Disney movies were stopped. Netflix also enjoy this but platforms like YouTube which were free to watch and made money from advertisement got high numbers of viewers but less revenue as advertisement dropped drastically.

Gone was the days when humans were needed to do everything but with AI, a lot of people are going to be less needed for a lot of actions. Before I continue, what is Artificial intelligence?

I just used my Google assistant to ask for the definition of Artificial intelligence, and this was the result I got.
> In computer science, artificial intelligence, sometimes called machine learning is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by human and animals – Wikipedia.

Artificial Intelligence was coined by John McCarthy and since then this intelligence have grown in computers thereby making computers smart and be able to learn from things around them. Artificial intelligence have become part of our daily lives and I will be sharing a few things that now work with AI.

If you are familiar with economic crises, you will realize that no matter the industry whatever happens in a bubble is caused by speculation, from the tulip mania in 1637, the dotcom crash in the 2000s and the real estate bubble in 2008. Speculation has been one thing that has driven a lot of market to its peak then to the humpty dumpty great fall which crashes the economy.

This post will be looking into a bubble I am sure a lot of us haven’t heard about before and that’s the *Souk al-Manakh* bubble of 1982 in Kuwait. We know Kuwait is a country relatively smaller than the US in land mass and population but did this country go about a bubble so large to cost a nation $90,000 in debt which is valued at $240,000 in 2019 based on inflation. The Souk al-Manakh bubble was a worth $266 billion as at 1982 estimated in quadrillions based on inflation in 2019.

I am sure if I ask for the name of one person you will be able to say a name of a political elite who in one way or the other influences the decisions made in the country. Power has been known to change hands from one person to another but for centuries now political elites have been transferring power from bloodline to bloodline, from generation to generation and they hold this power firmly and take it as a birthright and an inheritance. No doubt, this people’s decisions and believes affect a lot of our lives from the circulation of money and wealth, to political elections, commerce and economic decisions.

Founded in 1906 by Charles Stewart Rolls and Henry Royce with the aim of building a perfect motor car. The company has had several models that sell well from the Phantom, Ghost, Wraith, Cullinan and many more, the cars aren’t meant for people who can’t afford to feed a pet and give the pet a royalty life.

For companies that aren’t public yet, it is easy to calculate the value of the company as the value is the total number of asset, and income subtracting liabilities and expenses but when a company becomes public, it is a different ball game. The net worth of the company is gotten by multiplying how many shares of a company exist by the how much each shares is worth. Simple you will say, yes it is simple which means if a company and 2 Million shares and each shares is worth $20, then the company will be valued at $40 million which means it has $40 million dollars in capitalization. This is the same for companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Apple and many more.

### Introduction
You might be asking what this is, some people might even wonder what a dividend is; let me help a little. A dividend is an amount paid by a company annually, quarterly or in three months (depending on the company and when they pay their dividend) to shareholders from the profit made in the company. In other words, if you buy a shares from Apple or any other publicly traded company, then you own a part of the company and the company pays you dividend in cheques to your broking account every time they will be distributing it. Which means you got a passive income.

frederickbangs,guidelines-to-making-appropriate-decisions-in-business,Guidelines to Making Appropriate Decisions in Business,hive-175254,"As a business grows, there seem to be lots of daily demands and there comes an urge to make life a working cycle. The life of an entrepreneur describes extreme hard work, on several occasions it seem the days are too short and time is never on a considerable part. These things will continue to happen as long as the business continues to blossom, but as difficult as it may sound, learning to say yes or no to tasks makes a lot of difference. As much as you want your business to grow, it is also good to take charge of your life by knowing when to say yes and when to say no. Living a life of accepting to do everything, means you have signed up for a stressful and a difficult life, being an entrepreneur does not mean you should go all stressed up all the time. Building the courage to say yes or no at the appropriate time implies that you are getting your life in the right manner.

The method of funding that will be chosen, must be one that has been carefully considered, the various methods of funding must be adequately researched upon, the advantages and the disadvantages must also be clearly understood before moving on with the chosen path.

Someone who feeds on the profit from a business, might not be aware of certain ethical values required from an entrepreneur and why it is important to obey them. There is another person who is indeed passionate about going into business and has the finance to do so, might even get support from family members and friends and sometimes have an extra job to keep up personal survival and this means profit from the business is used for improving the business. Someone who has this luxury might not understand business ethics.

Differentiating between your needs, your wants and your obligations, will make you financially sustainable.

In order for humans to live, certain things cannot be ignored, those things are called our needs, and our needs includes: feeding, clothing, transportation, these factors considered to be needs have to be categorized according to level of incomes. You cannot be a low income earner and try to fit into the class of those who dress on a high-class level without going into bankruptcy.

From my findings and my assessment as a customer, nobody has ever bought a product or services because of the producer or the seller. As a consumer, we all buy products and services because they are important to us and they are going to be solving our needs as at the time or in the future. Every buying decision by a customer is done by the customer’s instinct. A customer can decide to buy a product or pay for a service from anybody and nobody, they are not entitled to getting a product from one producer/ seller.

One major difficulty in starting a business is finding a very good location. Not all business owners are able to afford buying a landed property for their business, in fact majority of the businesses lease or rent spaces so business activities can commence.

Let me make something straight clear that not all businesses need a great location to start. The location of a business should be dependent on the nature of the business. Businesses where you have to go to the customers, rather than vice versa do not really need an amazing location since you go to find your customers, do business and deliver it to them. In most cases your customers do not care about the location of the business provided they are getting their services rendered to them. In cases where the business involves retailing, marketing, advertising, etc. where customers will have to come in and go out often, t","{""tags"":[""hive-175254"",""business"",""steemleo"",""steem-leo"",""business-location""],""image"":[""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYYBFfW29XB7j8dig2x8BWRaaW2DF7WE4H6B3NoFswnKa/great-business-location.jpg"",""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdrWd4pbQdQBxfe5eu7Lb4ZcU6oq3cCh34Wc8KyZguAgF/location.jpg""],""links"":[""https://www.pinterest.com/"",""https://www.caminofinancial.com/things-to-consider-when-selecting-your-business-location/amp/""],""app"":""steemit/0.2"",""format"":""markdown""}",2020-03-05 15:21:03,A Good Business Location Means Good Business ( Consideration when getting a business location),/hive-175254/@frederickbangs/a-good-business-location-means-good-business-consideration-when-getting-a-business-location,10

Marketing is a major key to sales in any enterprise, business, and firm, not leaving the fact that marketing also cut across humans (“the way you dress is the way you are addressed” is a marketing word). With all this said, even events need marketing since it involves consuming a service.
