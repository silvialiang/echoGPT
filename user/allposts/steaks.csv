To tell you the truth, I only listened to the queen because she's the queen but I did not think about it because I felt the proper proposition had not been done, Aigbon said.

The arrogance of Aigbon was getting to the queen and it infuriated her, had it been that it was her son who wanted to marry his daughter, she would have caused a stir by putting him in a proper place.

He even excuded so much disregards for the throne simply because he was the father of the girl they had come for.

Kola is offered to welcome and it is accepted for being welcomed. Your words of welcome are enough kola to us, the King said.
Aigbon chuckled. People may say this Aigbon is a stingy man but it is only a thing of principle. I have made not giving kola in my house a way of life so as to wade off unnecessary vultures who only visit to fill their stomach, Aigbon said.

Expectation is the mother of manifestation. When the desirable is not available the available becomes desirable.

The man who fails to plan plans to fail the fear of failure is the beginning of failure. Loss no confidence, believe in yourself that you can be the best. Be yourself always and don't pretend.

This is a popular saying in Nigeria and it depicts the relationship between mother and child.

It follows the law of karma in a way, as we Africans strognly believe in ""spare the rod and spoil the child"" and as such, if a child is found wanting in his duties at home, it is believed that a good way to correct the child(ren) is by spanking.

This is an act of love here in Africa as it has saved lots of kids from ending up as rogues or thieves or societal nuisance and also saved lots of youth from death.

I advise parents to do these things for their children so as to enable them to gain interest in reading books and love education.

Meanwhile, when it comes to experience, there are two types (Good and Bad). The good ones bring good memories and make you happy while the bad ones make you feel bad and sad. These bad ones make you think and feel bad and regretful.

> Regrets looks back. Worry looks around. Vission looks up.

There is a Yoruba adage that says ""A child stumbles on a stone and looks forward while an adult stumbles on a stone and looks backwards"". Truthfully, life is understood backwards, but it must be lived forward.

A young is given 5 million Naira, he has the right ability to think, to see and to think. He can decide to use the money for whatever you want to use it. Then the young man decided to buy a car for 4.5 million now and started driving the car.

Keeping to time has become an almost impossible thing for humans nowadays, so many people are never early to an event before, they go late to offices, dates, meetings, conferences and even religious centers. The one thing about them is the fact that they stil always have one thing or the other to blame for their lateness.

I want to share something I have noticed about myself for a while now. I have been passing through this same thing for a while now and it has now become a déjavu.

There was a time when I was working in the plastic factory as a clerk. I loved and enjoyed the stay in the firm. My boss was nice and caring, other workers and colleagues were great. As much as i enjoyed the whole thing, i use to have issues with my closing hours.

I make more errors during closing hours than during working hours. I always thought maybe because i was in a rush but soon i realised that i made a lot of mistake because of something else.

There have been so many believe that the mother is or was the one who took care of every child with no or little credit for the fathers. Truth be told, mothers have always played important roles in the life of an individual because they bore them.

Is it that fathers do not make any sacrifice at all or are they not just referenced or acknowledged in the upbringing of children. From my dtudy, i have noticed that a father do a lot for a child but the reason why a mother's name can not be ommitted is because they are always around the child.

Why will you come to my house all of a sudden to tell me you are a friend 
Claiming to be my best friend, yet you pretend to me and never tell me the truth
You tell me A and B, You tell me you are white whereas you are black
You make me feel like I am precious when you slander me around
You tell people what i do not do and what I'm not.

You carry me when you are me but you drop me when i turn my back
You do not provide me shelter but you say it to those who care to listen that you do provide me with food and clothing
What a blunt and gallant liar you are
Your lips are full of rotten words, words that smell and chase people off

Ohh I wished we never crossed part
In my own words, I would say i cause the day i knew you.
Do i need to cause the day? 
Rather the day was blessed but you were a curse to the day

You slanderer, you liar.
You unfaithful and ungrateful hypocrite
You have shown your real colour to me and I'm glad i knew it immediately
