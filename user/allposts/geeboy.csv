The process of collecting and evaluating information on hazards associated with the food under consideration to decide which are significant and must be addressed in the HACCP plan. 

**CONTROL MEASURE**
 Any action or activity that can be used to prevent, eliminate or reduce a significant hazard

**CRITICAL CONTROL POINT**
It is a step at which control can be applied and is essential to prevent or eliminate a food safety hazard or reduce it to an acceptable level.

**Seed Formation**
Plants reproduce using eggs and sperm, just like people. However, they don't have physical sex! Male plants release pollen, which fertilizes the ovary. The fertilized ovaries develop into seeds, which can then be distributed to make new plants. As the fertilized ovaries develop, a surplus of carbohydrates and proteins are stored inside the seed. This will serve as food for the plant until it can develop leaves. Next, the fertilized plant ovaries develop the hardened coat we se","{""tags"":[""agriculture"",""science"",""steemitmag"",""geeboy""],""users"":[""geeboy""],""image"":[""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a0/6f/91/a06f9158b2e01bda67811c6099dcade3.jpg"",""https://img.youtube.com/vi/3Ij1eW_gsrM/0.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmQts5JmexHkrBLCt9Jo3bMXAT76xeCFWsZbcJnipujF6N/geeboy1.png""],""links"":[""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a0/6f/91/a06f9158b2e01bda67811c6099dcade3"",""https://youtu.be/3Ij1eW_gsrM"",""http://byjus.com/biology/seed-germination"",""http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-seed-germination-definition-process-steps-factors"",""http://www.tutorvista.com/content/biology/biology-iv/plant-growth-movements/seed-germination-process.php""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-03-27 16:33:12,SEED GERMINATION,/agriculture/@geeboy/seed-germination,1

A high-hearted person or a proud person cannot perceive the holy spirit and spiritual things.  the humble will be honored in life, while the proud always find it hard to get certain things. would you help someone who tells you he doesn't need you at all meanwhile he needs you but because of pride he wants to show superiority. The Lord exalts the humble and resists the proud.

Has your life suddenly become meaningless? Then you need the Jesus who alone is able to turn water into wine. 

When you allow Jesus to come into your life, your life begins to witness changes that will make people who know you before to admit to the fact that your life is sweet. Those who drank the water Jesus turned to wine testified of its sweetness.

Arise and straighten up your relationship with Jesus and enjoy a sweetened life

They don't remember Jesus' invitation that says ""come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest"" (Matt 11:28). To 'rest' in the on text means to depend on christ to take over the wheels of your life. It is to throw your life at his feet in careless abandonment; believing that he will take care of you.

**Useful tips on how to enter into rest**
* Get the inner peace that comes from an intimate relationship with God (Matthew 11:28-30; 1 Pet. 5:7)
* Give no room for doubt and unbelief (Prov. 3:5; 2Cor. 10:5, Ps 150:1)

Nobody can stop you with vain and ill words except you let them do it. What you spend time to meditate upon is what affects you, not what was said against you. 


You do not expect everyone to say something good about you, do you? it is natural for people to express their feelings, perceptions and judgement about what they see. Never let words of people trigger unnecessary action from you, neither should you allow their judgement determine your attitude. Do not do things because someone said you can't do them, only do things for the right reasons. Do things you know you can and for the right purpose.

Draw strength from the things you love, and let you satisfaction come from the good result you get.

The principle of planning requires preempting or envisaging every intending event or activity before they happen. You see things ahead and let them play out on paper first before letting them play out in the real world.

The accumulation of glycogen in certain organs and tissues, especially muscles, impairs their ability to function normally. The disease is named after Johannes C. Pompe, a Dutch doctor who first described the disorder in 1932 in an infant patient.  Pompe can affect people of all ages, with symptoms first occurring at any time from infancy to adulthood. Pompe disease causes muscle weakness and trouble breathing. It mostly affects the liver, heart, and muscles.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) describes brain degeneration likely caused by repeated head traumas. It is a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had a severe blow or repeated blows to the head. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was formerly believed to exist primarily among boxers, and was referred to as dementia pugilistica; but it was discovered that it afflicts the brain of people who have suffered repeated concussions and traumatic brain injuries, such as athletes who take part in contact sports, members of the military and others.

Child abuse arises when either one or both parents, or other adult and children, that causes serious physical or emotional harm to a child.

Many parents are emotionally abusive. However, emotional abuse invariably accompanies physical and sexual abuse.
parents who are emotionally abusive or who abuse children, practice forms of child-rearing that are orientated towards fulfilling their personal needs and goals, rather than those of their children. 
Examples of child abuse is nearly starving a child to death for one reason or another.

Cancer begins in the cells, which are the building blocks of the body. Normally, the body forms new cells as needed, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when they are not needed, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a **tumor**. Tumors can be benign or malignant.

The ability of microorganisms to transform environmental contaminants to final products harmless to man and environment has been a subject of laboratory investigations since the 60ies.

Bioremediation is the use of microorganisms to destroy or immobilize waste materials.
Microorganisms include:
Bacteria (aerobic and anaerobic)
Fungi
Actinomycetes (filamentous bacteria)

Research has demonstrated that there are very few environments where microbes have not been able to survive, adapt, and indeed, thrive. Microbes are able to utilize a near infinite combination of electron donors and electron acceptors to drive their metabolism.
Bioremediation strategies are often more beneficial than traditional strategies because it can be implemented in situ (directly at the site of the contaminant with no need to transport the contaminat","{""tags"":[""biology"",""science"",""education""],""image"":[""http://www.livemint.com/r/LiveMint/WebArchive/BP/Photos/2015-07-21/Processed/Mint/Web/w_g_Science_Bioremediation.jpg"",""https://iusustain.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/bioremediation.jpg"",""https://userscontent2.emaze.com/images/c0b95c7e-cf0a-43e6-9778-02123cf30113/629032df689564f3b9db20d8dea022de.jpg""],""links"":[""http://www.livemint.com"",""https://iusustain.files.wordpress.com"",""https://userscontent2.emaze.com""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-01-05 16:44:03,BIOREMEDIATION,/biology/@geeboy/bioremediation,1

Viruses are extraordinarily simple particles of matter with at least one property of living things,**the ability to replicate**
Viruses are genetic elements that can not replicate independently of a living cell, called the host cell. Viruses rely on the host cell for energy, metabolic intermediates, and protein synthesis. Viruses are therefore obligate intracellular parasites that rely on entering a suitable living cell to carry out their replication cycle.
To multiply, viruses must enter a cell in which they can replicate, a process called *infection*.
Viruses can replicate in a way that is destructive to the host cell, due to the fact that some viruses are agents of disease.
Compared to eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, viruses are extraordinarily simple in their physical and chemical properties. Viruses are acellular. They generally consist of a piece of nucleic acid encased in protein and, in some cases, a membrane like envelope.

*what is parasitology*?
Parasitology can be defined as a discipline that deals with the study of parasites and their interactions with their hosts.

*what is a parasite*?
A parasite is a living organism, which takes its nourishment, shelter and other needs from a host.
*what is a host*?
A host is an organism which supports the parasite. 

Parasites are protozoa, helminthes, and some arthropods.

**DIFFERENT KINDS OF PARASITES**

1)  Ectoparasite – a parasitic organism that lives on the outer surface of its host, for example: lice, ticks, mites etc.

2) Endoparasites – parasites that live inside the body of their host, for example: *Entamoeba histolytica*.

3) Obligate Parasite - This parasite is completely dependent on the host during a segment or all of its life cycle, for example: Plasmodium spp.

Marriage is the union between a man and a woman to become husband and wife. Marriage is as old as man, making it the oldest institution on earth. Marriage is a definite mark of the end of one era and the beginning of another era.

Marriage is a union that requires agreement between the both parties. The consent of the lady must be sought by the man through marriage proposal. At this juncture, the lady is thoughtful before giving a response which may be either *yes* or *no*.
Courtship begins on the day the man's proposal is accepted by the lady. Courtship is a time during which each party in the relationship is to open up to each other.

The journey to marriage begins with maturity, it needs to be emphasised that maturity is neither biological or age-wise.

Ayaba moremi ajasoro was a wife to OONI Oranmiyan of Ile-Ife the son of OONI ODUDUWA. Her face radiates with beauty like that of the early morning sun. Ayaba Moremi Ajasoro was a faithful wife and a steadfast supporter of OONI Oranmiyan and Ile-Ife. 
At a time a neighbouring tribe called **Igbo** were always invading Ile-ife dressed  in raffia palms. The igbo's were enslaving the Yoruba's. During this period Moremi Ajasoro had to offer anything she had as sacrifice to the Spirit of the river Esimirin in order to discover the strength of her nation's enemies.

Has it ever occurred to you that there are biblical keys to success.
Let's take a look at some
1) Seest thou a man **diligent** in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men. Proverbs 22 vs 29 - KJV.
2) Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with **thy might**; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. Ecclesiastes 9 vs 10 - KJV
3)  Yet a **little sleep, a little slumber**, a little folding of the hands to sleep:So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.  Proverbs 24 vs 33 and 34 - KJV
4) In the morning **sow thy seed**, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. Ecclesiastes 11 vs 6 - KJV
5) Plans fail without **advice**, but with many counselors they are confirmed.

Love makes the world go round and round. It is the only antigen that makes the antibody in the heart respond. when it invades it, the heart first lines of defence (doubt and fear) tries to fight it but due to the virulence factor of love, it colonizes the heart and leaves it with several symptoms like lost thought, . love then is cultured and viewed to confirm which specie it is, but i'ts taxonomy has not been nomenclatured

It is true that the way you perceive things around you is the way you  address them. that also all back to a persons taste of things.

One mans best is another mans less, that word goes a lot with this. you might love to do what i dislike doing, but there is something i don't  agree with and that's criticizing others taste of things because you dont like it or you have a bad taste about it.

I should not criticize you about one religion because i'm of the other.
I should not criticize you because you prefare to live downtown, why i don't.
I should  not criticize your taste of nationality or race because i'm different
I should not critiicize your choice of action because it's inversly proportional to mine
I should not criticize your marital status or way of life
and many more
Also that also goes for you. Dont criticize anybody for what they choose or their taste

Birds produce beautiful notes.
The Songbirds have an organ called the syrinx in their throat. This syrinx helps the bird to sing beautiful notes at a time. To sing, a bird blows air from the lungs through the syrinx.

I was the reason why men had parties and get togethers.
At night, I had several ladies at my table wanting to have dinner with me, and princes from different countries fixing date to seat and have a banquet.

All of a sudden, I see them no more. What could have changed, where did I go wrong,  where did I miss it.
 Now I see no one instead of everyone. I see empty tables instead of banquets,

There is an old saying ""no food for a lazy man"" surprisingly, many people are neither ready to use their hands, sweat, or brain to their daily living, instead a lot of people have turned themselves to ""hangers-on""
The rhetorical question is how do you handle the work or task commited to your care?

Prayer is a method by which God and man interact. It's a communication link. Through prayer, you are able to pour out your heart to God and HE, in turn, unfolds his heart to you. Luke 18:1

prayer is not all about pouring your heart to God but much more, it is a time of fellowship with your creator. This is why you must create time for these glorious moments. Prayer cannot be overlooked in a man's life. Prayer does much more than you ever know.
Prayer is a two-way affair; you talk to God and God answers you. God answers all prayers; do you know?. YES!!! God does answer prayers, he either tells you YES to your prayer or he tells you NO to your request. Nut he does answer prayer.

One of the more recent startups to see the benefit of increased investor interest in the broader ecosystem is Ledger. Founded in 2015, the Paris-based technology startup creates a number of various hardware solutions for cryptocurrencies and blockchains, including security solutions for enterprises and digital wallet hardware for consumers.

The hardware solutions work to remove the potential point of failure implicit in digital cryptocurrency storage. Hackers can still gain access to someone’s computer and digital bitcoin wallets.

According to local news publication Times of India, the group, operating in Mumbai, used the virtual currency ship postage stamp-style blots of the drug via courier services.

LSD is colorless and odorless, making it hard to detect. Much like Bitcoin, however, its pseudo-anonymous qualities are no longer a match for sophisticated tracers.
