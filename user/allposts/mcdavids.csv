There was a great famine in the land and everyone had to look for a means to survive, it got so bad that people started to eat raw grass and things were getting worse by the day.


Mr Tortoise left the village in search of a greener pasture, he got a job that he started doing although it was really difficult because he had to lift heavy loads on his back and carry it over a long distance . It was really stressful for him but he had no other option because he needed to survive, he was getting paid and he got free food as there was abundance of food in the village .

Skill acquisition has now been believed to be for the poor or for people who cannot afford western education while western education has become for the rich as the fee to acquire the degrees keep rising everyday.

Personally, I feel that skill acquisition should be as well learned with the acquisition of degree programmes (western education) as this really helps in so many ways.

In a country like Nigeria, there is a high amount of students who graduates yearly and you will see even first class graduates carrying their files up and  down the street looking for a place to work, they walk round tirelessly round the street daily only to get back home frustrated at night .

True words are never spoken to make you laugh and smile, they are said to restructure our way of life.

Some people are bent at telling you lies, they nevr want to tell you what will make you succeed. They are willing to tall you what you want to hear. The less you associate with those kind of people the more your life will improve. 

A mediocre mind create a mediocre lifestyle and any time you tolerate mediocrity from other people, it states clear that you also possess a mediocre state of life.

For days now, weeks counting and months to be precise 2 months, i have been keeping  bushy  hairs, beards and mustache. Dirty isn't it, laugh out loud. Do not mind me, i was referring to a good friend of mine.

I always asked him to get a shave but he wouldn't listen. He would tell me he loved the feeling of the hairs and that the beards, armpit hair and mustache were absorbing the sweat from his body.

### Truthfully speaking i think he is right. The human private and public part hairs actually absorb and trap both sweat and dirt, which is a good importance of having hair on your body. Also it serves as a regulator and shield for cold and hotness of the body.

Humility is a state of being humble, it is a level of total submission.

 Humble people are the ones who rule the world because they get all that they want with their good morals.

Humble people are good and trust worthy people.

Humble people know how to maintain relationships.

Life is subjective to growth, growth is essential for a basic life continuity.
Sustenance is what keeps us alive, what helps our growth and keeps our sanity.
As kids we were helplessly made to totally rely or depend on parents, siblings and even family members as they were the only ones we could look up to for help, when we want food, water or any other necessary amenities, we go to our parents who in turn provides us with what they could offer.

 But, it becomes mandatory that as life goes on and as growth occur, we need to start moving beyond always requesting for things from our parents and loved ones to getting things on ","{""tags"":[""life"",""nigeria"",""africa"",""growth""],""users"":[""mcdavids""],""image"":[""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ppaXnn912ig/VjkrITm-llI/AAAAAAAAC6k/3se1cTNxBk0/s1600/merch%2Bsustainability.jpg"",""http://www.craikecovillage.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/healthy-body.jpg"",""http://www.ladyandtheblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-24-at-3.05.56-PM.png""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=imgres&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjTz56Pss_VAhVjD8AKHdduCMQQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.personaleco-nomist.com%2Fp%2Fabout-sustainable-living.html&psig=AFQjCNFYB2LA5gWnhz58lT-NtW3MsjhEkw&ust=1502548131088433"",""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=imgres&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj_sIDzsc_VAhVBB8AKHdFKCeIQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.craikecovillage.ca%2F04%2F28%2Fsustainable-living-and-a-healthy-body-are-the-secret-to-a-happy-life%2F&psig=AFQjCNGcSneI8VvpuK9cX_xb3H8kAZ5ElQ&ust=1502548070536662"",""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=imgres&cd=&cad=rj",2017-08-11 14:35:27,Building a Self-Sustainable Life,/life/@mcdavids/building-a-self-sustainable-life,0

In my dream, I was a queen because I got married to a very handsome king who had the attention of every maiden in our home town, but he specially choose me among all of them so I was the envy of every maiden around as I walked majestically from pillar to post with pride and maids at my service.

Our characters has the ability to either make or mare us.

# Are there good and bad characters?

 I will not want to make conclusions as to if good or bad characters exist because I am of the believe that everyone has different views towards life but then I am of a strong opinion that people should live their lives in a generally acceptable manner, in a way that people will see and appreciate or commend you.

Majority of the parents in the world believes that their children should go to school in other to Succeed. It is a major belive in Africa pricisely west Africa and Nigeria to be more precised.

I always hear this ""go to school and make a living for yourself, if you don't go you would be a failure"". Then I'm forced to ask

Does Schooling determine success? 
---
Do every successful person attend school? 
---
Do schools teach how to be successful?

___

A,B,C.....1,2,3...... Is this how to be successful?

We have heard of several electrical reforms by the government trying to increase the megawatt of the power supply but it hasn't proven positive.

The decision is yours!

Inspiration they say is a critical requirement for great achievements. Biography is an important source of inspiration. However, biography is unique in that it as a rule documents of totality (successes and failures) of the life of men and women; highlighting how they sail through life. The man whose life we want to consider as a source of inspiration is Sir Isaac Newton.

Newton in his life time branched into many areas of science - His investigations included Mathematics, theology, mechanics, dynamics, optics, history and chemistry and his achievements were also legion.
He invented a new branch of maths called ca","{""tags"":[""science"",""inspiration"",""biography"",""nigeria"",""physics""],""image"":[""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1GXr-xmo0PU/TyGHIuR6FXI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/VNetyABQyv4/s1600/Newtom%2Band%2Bapple%2Bstory.PNG"",""http://www.christianitytoday.com/images/68400.jpg?w=700"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmWxm8bn4kmor4PSTJuRmprihDmmxxVfwmoGayyjEa1f1c/image.png"",""http://necesitodetodos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/isaac-newton-cita-2.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmcGTgE9ztQ7QmWESyE7uVqLrUqfbAa1fsTCod6dmsFYjP/GENERIC.gif"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmUS6oHpughzQduoENLB3319rm5kh4Xgx1JcGjnAYZnnV2/steemy%20vote.jpg""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi0rdHZnLDVAhXSZ1AKHUC3CFoQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcricshoot.blogspot.com%2F2012%2F01%2Fbest-idea-ever-newton-and-apple.html&psig=AFQjCNHUN7iXSMXqeQEmgZFrijLRHmxeQQ&ust=1501477221510325"",""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjcwNXQnbDVAhVEalAKHeJkBjgQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%",2017-07-30 05:06:27,Be Inspired By Reading Biographies; The Story Of The Greatest Scientist Of All Time,/science/@mcdavids/be-inspired-by-reading-biographies-the-story-of-the-greatest-scientist-of-all-time,1

Some people expect that they sould be placed on high values when even they themself do not look at themselve as being able to make something good out of themselves. There are some individuals in the society who believe that they were created to serve others and that their destiny does not warrant the good things of life, so they die being slaves to the wealthy ones.

 Self love, self acceptance and self appreciation are importance factors that cannot be over ephasized, i know of some people who do not like anything about thier body but they always admire other people's body and people like that always expect that they get love and appreciation from others which is not possible because they have presented themself as being de valued.

In Africa, most especially Nigeria, burying a deceased most especially an old one is done with elaborate ceremonies.

So many people spend thousands and millions of Naira, just to throw a party they call **burial party** where they would kill cows, cook different classes of food, call live bands and play music. Most of the people burying the deceased go as far as collecting loans from banks and after the burial celebration party, they start running up and down looking for how to pay back the debts they are in.

I have one simple question

Is it necessary to throw big parties when you lose a family member?

> Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve - Napoleon Hill

# THINK

Attaining greatness is not a day job. The dream of yesterday is the reality of today and the vision of tomorrow. The way you perceive people does not mean that is the way they see themselves. 

You might see me as a weak person but I see myself as a giant. I am a student studying medicine, doesn't mean I am a medical doctor at heart, Being a medical student doesn't guarantee my success as a medical student. I might be a medical student, and my heart would be at the golf club.


The way you think is the way you act, what you think is what you become. I cannot think like a chicken and expect to soar like an eagle. Your thinking affects your life. Think big and reap big, think small and remain small.

Hello steemians

Two days ago i was able to meet with a friend of mine @gbenga in ile-ife.

We hung out and he told me about his fire for the steemit community growth. At first, I thought he was insane or maybe paranoid, but after a little chat, I discovered he tends to be **steemit sick**.

<center>![circle steemit logo.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYMgGZgypCjHTEh5rGeWL5JQzkmbjtKwVRx6A5tngB6uT/circle%20steemit%20logo.png)</center>

Not long he got a call from his hommy, and the first thing he did was to introduce him to steemit. about ten minutes later his friend arrived at the eatery. He did a lot of explanation and behold @harbysco is born to steemit.

I tend to love this @gbenga steemit virus, and i think i'm getting infected gradually. I would love if steemians could show @gbenga some support as well as help to improve the community.

Have you tried posting with esteem before, well i used it today, and I liked it.

Today, I was busy all through in school but I wanted to post on Steemit. So I downloaded the esteem application from Google Play.

It was a good experience. It wasn't really different from the Steemit site on desktop and I love it.

So back to what I wanted to post. Today I actually helped a friend post on Steemit. Anyway she is new here and I would love if steemians could show love by upvoting Her.

She is a very shy person I must say but she is fun to be with. Her name is @anyagladys. Please steemians show her love and give her warm welcome.","{""links"":[],""image"":[""https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/806331689106599936/Of249XZw.jpg""],""users"":[""anyagladys""],""tags"":[""introduction"",""introduceyourself"",""mcdavidshouse"",""esteem"",""minnowsupport""],""app"":""esteem/1.4.5"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""community"":""esteem""}",2017-06-24 18:10:06,Using Esteem For The First Time And Introducing @anyagladys,/introduction/@mcdavids/using-esteem-for-the-first-time-and-introducing-anyagladys-2017624t1995644z,7

Today i would be viewing a question which says ""have you ever wasted your time trying to explain yourself to people who have proven that they are committed to misunderstanding you?""

Sometime back, I had a roommate who would always see things i do as being wrong. She barely believed I could do nothing right and would utilize every opportunity she gets to make me feel miserable. We would argue over every little thing not because I wanted to argue with her, but because she always call for it.

It is a common thing to praise Jehovah when good things happen or when everything is rosy. However, it takes real courage to offer praise when you have a tough problem.

When the wind appears to blow contrary, many people don't see any reason for thanking God. Why? This is because they often want to know **the direction Jehovah was looking before the wind arose**. They become weary, frustrated and dejected in the face of troubles. They think He is either distant from them or He does not really care for them! Friend, let me tell you one thing that gives victory when life seems to be adversely dealing with you.

Praising God in the time of adversity is a proven way to victory. Although, it is not a natural response to battles of life, but i encourage you to always praise Jehovah.

Praise invites the presence of God and paves way for his power to manifest. Praise passes your prayer to God. It helps you place your trust in God and takes you away from problems.

Do you think life is fair?

life gives to some and take away from some; life promotes some and demote some;

life chooses who is personality and who is nonentity. 

life is not a one way thing. it is a ladder that doesn't go straight up. It goes up and down.

steemit is everything, and anything, it is a decentralized blockchain that pays you for what you know how to do best. I am a newbie here looking for the right way so i would not miss my steps.

If you read my first post you should know more about me. Ok lets say i love to do more of writing, chatting, and catching fun.

i have heard that steemit is a community that welcomes newbies very warmly, but i did not feel that on my first introduction post and i want to feel it.

I have heard of the Whales, the Dolphins and the Minnows and i heard that the three categories are friendly, loving and caring.

just few businesses accept it at the moment. This will change as time goes on.

It takes a trained eye to recognize them. In the same way, opportunities in come disguised in “work clothes” – as problems or challenges to be overcome.

Today, I will be giving reasons why being grateful is important and the reasons why we need to be grateful.

First and foremost, you need to be grateful for live, the fact that you slept and woke up again is something to be thankful for, there are some people who would sleep and will not have the opportunity to wake up and see the light of the next day, but because you are opportune to see another beautiful day then you need to be grateful.
