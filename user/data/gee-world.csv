Planning is what I refer to as a step by step procedure to accomplishment. It requires arranging things before acting.

I have noticed that so many people do not plan before they do things, they just do things anyhow. Do you make plans for your future, what you do, what you eat, what you wear, and all.

Planning requires information, and the information is what is needed for a successful pursuit. 

>“Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.” - Allen Saunders

Do you desire to change so as to become a better individual? Then start working on planning. Like Socrates said, ""Anyone who will move the world, must first move"".

He sometimes likes to grab food at a fast food joint but tonight was different as he prepared the yam and egg in a special and different type of way that I cannot forget in a hurry.

Food is ready gee, it is time to eat and I put out my little head from the womb in a way that the food could get into my mouth directly and I loved it.

I wish that my dad will prepare a food like this for me more often so that I can have a good time enjoying my meal.

The prince began to ask Amati how she related with Fatima but she was not firm with her answers, she just told the king to go in and kindly talk things over with Fatima and if for any reason she accepts him, then they can talk about their relationship. The prince accepted that and went to meet with Fatima, but his face when he came out depicted that of a defeated warrior.

You could possibly develop a big stomach when you begin to eat a lot of sugary food.

Belly fat comes up when you take excessive alcohol as well.

Eating diets low in protein may result in having belly fat.

I have noticed that most women I see around have a big stomach, I see them around with beautiful shapes and pretty faces but the only problem is just the big stomach that comes out through the fitted cloth.

http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/28/15/36ABCCC700000578-3696536-image-a-3_1469717393796.jpg

There are some fitted cloth that I see women wear and it gets me really in love with them but having a flat stomach will make the whole thing perfect and even make them look more attractive, but that stomach just spoils the whole thing.

Sometimes when I sing, my voice is not pleasant even to my own hearing, but I still love to sing anyways.

Sometimes, my dad will even tap me and I know that is to make me remember that my voice is not so pleasing so whenever I want to disturb him, I will make sure that I sing as this will get him angry.

But I like to sing because it elevates my soul, it makes me happy and glad.

Singing makes me feel light, it also reminds me of the fact that I will be fine.

On our way home, my dad wanted to use a public toilet and he searched around but he could not find any one to use, he needed to use the toilet very fast and luckily for us, we found a local public toilet around us.

A great lesson from the wise is our ability to remain quiet even when it seem as if we have the best idea of the entire situation, there is a blessing attached to quite listening.

It is only a wise man that will remain quiet in order to add more to his knowledge despite all that he knows.

A wise man knows how to handle his family properly, even when his wife is complaining or nagging out of anger or frustration, he remains quiet about the whole issue.

But on the contrary, you do not have to become sincere and then get broke, it does not necessarily work that way, the truth is it depends on the way you see things.

You can become sincere and still be rich, it is not a thing of must to be poor because you are not sincere.

I wonder why this is so, why this is so, why is there no universal method for washing meat, and then I got an answer to it, the method at which you wash meat depends on how dirty the meat is and what exactly  the meat is to be used for.

I will be taking you through the means of washing meat properly, flow along with me your baby in the womb.

Carefully unwrap your meat into a neat bowl and add neat water to it, rinse gently in the first water detaching every excess flesh from the body, rinse the meat properly for the second time and put in another neat bowl.

After some months, the house was ready and Chidinma's parents were supposed to move in, but some of the chiefs and elders of the villagers created a rule that says that no one must live in a house that is bigger than that of the king of the village, thereby Chidinma's parents were not allowed to stay in the house built by their in-laws and they are supposed to leave the house for the king.

gee-world,another-experience-with-that-pretty-lady,Another Experience With That Pretty Lady,story,"The weekend was over very fast and my dad had stopped blaming himself, he consoled himself with the fact that after all he did not work for the money but somewhere in a little corner of his mind he just wished that he had been wise with the money.

When we got to work that Monday morning, my dad greeted everyone and they replied with a smile, Monday mornings are usually very refreshing at work as everyone looks fresh and radiant. I noticed my dad started smiling all of a sudden and when I peeped to see what was making him smile I realized that it was because he saw the lady we went on a date with some days back and I smiled as well because I know that means a good time for my dad and that might even help him forget about how he wasted money over the weekend.

Sometimes I wonder why I am in my dad's stomach instead of a woman's stomach as I have read in books that it is majorly women who carry unborn children in their womb.

On this faithful day, a pretty lady with high shoes, a skirt and a fitted shirt to match came to my dad's office to discuss some things as a representative of her own company, all the grammars they were speaking was too large for my little head to comprehend so I just ignored it.

I was opportune to witness a scenario where a mother was asking her children (3 boys) about one missing meat.

### The question is ""Must there always be a missing meat in the pot""

I wonder if parents most especially mothers count the meat in the pot or do they count it before cooking it, I do not understand.

When she comes back and start asking the question ""Who took the meat from the pot"", immediately the house becomes quite and everyone starts looking at themselves as if the question she asked was wrong or maybe she didn't know what she was saying.

Who discovered this simple arithmetic I always wondered, I always knew it will be someone very intelligent maybe a geek but i then asked, 

Why is 1 + 1 Not = 51.

Well 1 + 1 can be equals to anything you want it to be, you are not greater than your mind.

Your mind is the only thing that can proof what others feel is wrong as being right. Your mind is your greatest asset. The reason for your existence.

My brain is just so full now, you ask why? Because I have been reading a lot of newspapers yet haven't gotten anything new there.

I read five local newspapers in Nigeria this morning, only to discover that the everything i read on the paper had been said on TV and Radio, so what was special again.

What makes newspapers special

* The advert
* The comic
* Easy to read and understand
* Can go back to to stories and pages
* Can reference it
* Own it
* See diferent views to different stories
* Long life span
* Durable
* Affordable

Do you have a newspaper today, have you read one, If no get one... Do not think it is old fashioned, it is actually relevant.

I sang this song while my dad was running down the street so as to get home untime so as to escape the rain. I was under the rain as well since i'm in my dad's stomach, c'mon i'm not a fuetus, I'm a matured unborn baby who will be born on a day i do not know.

A friend of mine hurt me so bad that I made up my mind that I will never forgive her what she did was something that was just indescribable, I held her in mind for a long time and whenever I saw her it always brought back a reflection of what she did initially and it gave me great bitterness and pain.


I went for a conference one day, the conference was held by someone of great value and the person was as well my role model so I listened to all he had to say with interest. It wasn’t as if this was the first time I was listening to something on forgiveness, but this one was really different because it was someone I greatly admired so I listened with a keen and great interest and I promised to abide with all that was said.

I have noticed that some people do not use their creative mind at all. The most annoying of it all is the fact that they remain in their illusions where everything is just not more than what they see. I have noticed that the way you want things to be for you, is the way they will be.

A few years ago, a teacher was talking to his pupils in the class and he was teaching them about faith. I'm not been religious here, I'm only trying to tell you about the power of an opened mind.

We all think differently and we take things in different ways. The first time i visited Uyo in Akwaibom state Nigeria, i heard different kind of songs in a different dialect. A dialect totally different from what i and my other unborn siblings use in communication. The most amazing part of it is the fact that the people listening to the music were dancing unendingly as though the song was Hip hop or salsa.

**Kon koko kon ko koko ko...** the gang was sounding very loud and then there was a tamborine being played and so many other instrument. What amazed me the most was the Base pot that kept on hitting and giving the sound of a ponch **Boom Boom Boom**.

Hello my steemit friends

#### I have one question to ask, Are women mothers or slaves?

You will wonder why I say this if you do then let me share a little event with you. 12 hours ago, I, my siblings and dad were going to the market to buy something for my mum from the grocery store. Yes the grocery store, do not forget that I said my dad is the one carry I and my siblings in his stomach. Even though his stomach is starting to protrude and become visible, well he has no choice. I overheard my mum saying to him that he promised to carry us in his stomach until the delivery day which we do not know.

I was in my corner laying down at the north-eastern part of the womb, since my other urborn siblings have their beds in the other parts of the womb.

Soon I started hearing conversations from nowhere. I first thought maybe it was my siblings but i discovered they were enjoying their siesta. Ohh what a deep nap, that these elder siblings of mine can't even notice a noise around.

So i decided to look through my dad's navael which serves as Ocullar lens. I can see through his clothes and i always hear from the walls of the stomach. My dad is the person pregnant not my mum and what i heard brought me into steemit.
