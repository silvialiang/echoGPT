Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and event occuring in distinct succession from the past through the present and to the future.

### The Relevance of Time

#### Time waits for no man, constantly changing with no power to stop it

> Time is a circus always packing up and moving away.

> You may delay but time will not

#### Time is irreplaceable 

> Lost wealth may be replaced by industry, lost knowledge by study, lost health by temperance or medicine but lost time is gone forever.

#### Time is precious and worth more than wealth

>  An inch of time is an inch of gold but you can't buy that inch of time with an inch of gold

>  Your greatest asset is your earning ability. Your greatest resource is","{""tags"":[""life"",""motivation"",""nigeria"",""africa""],""image"":[""https://steemitimages.com/DQmaNjGE92DFfr5dHThbxdEGPZoytT7Cv4BiJ8Gov8Qc8Xi/images.jpg""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com.ng/search?q=time&client=ms-android-gionee&prmd=ivn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibie35wbvVAhXMEVAKHe32AEIQ_AUIESgB&biw=360&bih=560#imgrc=9gWgiQaZ3OmN_M:""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-08-03 17:01:51,The Essence of Time,/life/@harbysco/the-essence-of-time,18

All I have always seen most times is people writing things about their mother, asides writing 
making songs and doing all sort of thing just to acknowledge the love of their mother. Yes, mothers are very important in the life of every child. Their love knows no bound but I tell you only a father can love you more or as much as your mother. I love my mum and I sometimes wish I can draw back the hands of time just to tell her how much I love her. After my mum's demise, I got a better understanding of a father's love. 

I have always been a close buddy of my dad but I tell you, my mum is my closest companion. I got really close to my dad just after my mum's demise 4 years ago. Since then it has always been me and my dad","{""links"":[""https://www.google.com.ng/search?q=happy+birthday+dad&client=ms-android-gionee&prmd=ivn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6s7eNhufWAhUHSRoKHTbGA-4Q_AUIEigB#imgrc=Lsii6DRXQo37-M""],""image"":[""https://steemitimages.com/DQmbc6iyuKoUMos77G18NEYg3crrBtmNcRPSLYFsAT4AhdW/download.jpg""],""tags"":[""family"",""love"",""life"",""nigeria"",""whalepower""],""app"":""esteem/1.4.6"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""community"":""esteem""}",2017-10-10 22:13:24,Celebrating Fathers; Celebrating The Best Dad In The World.,/family/@harbysco/celebrating-fathers-celebrating-the-best-dad-in-the-world-20171010t231311193z,13

Having  some hearty discussion with one of my lecturer and mentor today, I was put through some lessons of life. During the course of discussion, he revealed to me some major ingredient of success he had always adopted and has been giving him positive outcome in his life. 

Some of the point stated are; 

* Never live your day without any specific plan.

* While mapping out a plan for your life, make sure it is a plan in line with your career.

* Let your daily plans be flexible enough because when you make rigid plans, life might pose it's own plan on yours 

* Think of the biblical saying ""never plan for what you'll eat tomorrow, let tomorrow take care of itself""

____

Moral: I'm not  saying you shouldn't make plans but while planning, think about the dynamism of life and make provisions for whatever unforeseen occurrences that life might pose to you.

At the end it all falls back to the decision we make. We are a product of our decision and the greatest power man can ever wield is the power to make a decision. Never blame anyone for your current situation as it all falls back to the decision you have made at a point in time. It's a known fact that a horse can be forced to a river but cannot be forced to drink water so is the fact that you are the only one capable of taking the right decision for yourself. In life their is always a choice, so it is left to you to take the right decision.

An opportunity of which I had to grab as I  have been really busy lately with my academics.  Meeting with Steemians has always been fun and this meet up likewise was fun as usual.  The organization was lit and we'll planned owing to the fact that it was held at one of the centre city in Southwest,Nigeria the turn up was massive with lots of Steemians travelling from far and wide. 

I won't be talking much about the event now as I will be making a post later in the day that will take you through the event as If you were there.

To whom it may concern,

Failure is an evidence you are trying, a prove that you are earnestly knocking on that door of opportunity. Failure most times is a disappointment but never forget once you fail you have learnt a new way to getting things right.
Let not your soul be saddened from failure as it is a necessary precursor to getting it right. Pick up yourself again and keep striving. Success is just around the corner.

At times we spend so much time trying to please people,  we spend lots and lots of time impressing them but recently I got to realize the only set of people that should be in your life are those that really love you for who you are, irrespective of who you are. 
A friend once said

> You can only control your actions, you can't determine people's reaction - Ifeoluwa Fatoki

So the question now is ""why try to go out of your own way of live to please people when it is possible that your actions might not be bring a pleasant reaction?"" 

I'm not saying you shouldn't try to improve yourself or some attitude, all I'm saying is; if you feel you need a change of attitude let the change be for yourself alone with no intent of pleasing or satisfying people. It is good to emulate characters that you feel will further better your life but not characters you feel will portray you as good ","{""tags"":[""motivation"",""nigeria"",""life"",""dailytonic"",""lifestyle""],""image"":[""https://steemitimages.com/DQmeM8kTygaMxT98yXg7zFSg8sgJgnGaNctWd2P9zTSwozE/IMG_20180219_234036_985.jpg""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-02-19 22:45:48,Quit Pleasing People...

Just like yesterday, we concluded the 2015 general elections. And just like tomorrow, the 2019 elections stare at us in the face.

Consultations, discussions and permutations cloud our political atmosphere.

The powers-that-be still want power, and the incumbent officers are not ready to vacate the seats.

Certain involvements come in. From tribalism to religion, sentiments come in.

Politicians wear the regalia of humility and tend to remember their people.

But does it stop there?

I don't think so. 

Godfathers still abound.

**Do you still feel you deserve more from your hard work?**

**Are you giving up on yourself already?**

At times we keep wondering why things are not turning up as it is suppose to be,  we feel our efforts is not yielding the proper fruit, we feel the bountiful seed of hard work we sow in our endeavors are not bringing out a proportionate yield. Yes, you are really striving  to make things work out fine but I tell you things will always remain the same if you fail to change your approach to things.

I suppose that the decay we now have in the world around us is as a result of decay in the family system! 

The first institution to ever exist was the family. Maybe this is because God knows it is integral to maintaining the level of sanity in our world.

In the family settings that existed long ago, parents had time for their children, and offered guidance. 

But today, they only have time for work, and a bit of partying!

The families of old valued communication, but these days, everyone is busy communicating with an ""abstract"" companion on the social media.

The world is fast changing! 
Values are fast disappearing!

Life is good, but it can be better. 

Life is good.
But imagine waking up one day with empty pockets. Or waking up on an empty stomach to see an empty pot. 

Life goes from good to bad, in an instant. 

Then you get on the media, and more bad, than good news surface.

But in all of this, we can yet carve out a niche of happiness for ourselves.

And to gain perspectives of happiness, we must keep the future in sight.

If we can always remind ourselves of the future we dream of, and work to build, we can sure be motivated to move on from the bad happenings.

Remember, that the key to your happiness lies with you!

And how you choose to see things, determines how happy you end up.","{""tags"":[""motivation"",""nigeria"",""life"",""dailytonic"",""lifestyle""],""image"":[""https://steemitimages.com/DQmcsmZjFpkLyi7g6XA1ZoP5P2iieDN7Z5FJSc36zivCCX1/images.png""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com.ng/search?q=happy&client=ms-android-transsion&prmd=ivn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwifkdOqqoXZAhVUWsAKHf78CiIQ_AUIESgB&biw=412&bih=612&dpr=2.63#imgrc=b3sHH49aqpFMrM:&isa=y""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-02-01 18:24:45,Daily Tonic...

We may talk about results, but there are no results without materials. 

And materials don't just become results without PROCESS! 

It takes process before the sperm and egg become a baby.
It takes process before raw food items become edible. 
It takes process before planted seeds become harvested crops! 

Recognition is based on results, but results without process is void! 

Don't just think about where you plan to end up. 

Think of how to get there. The ""How"" is the law of PROCESS

Never see yourself as better, always see yourself as opportuned. Yes, you feel you are hardworking but I tell you there are people that are more hardworking than you are but not as opportuned as you.
Life is not always fair but once you feel it is fair to you, never see yourself as better.  

Live your life and enjoy every bit of it.

We learn new things every day and there are many lessons learned in our day to day activities if we can be observant enough. Just at the ATM queue this afternoon I got a lesson. Many may see it as nothing but it's a great lesson. Just as I arrived at the ATM center I met a long queue on a single automated machine as the other two available machines were not dispensing as claimed by the people I met at the ATM center.

How time flies, it's just amazing to see that in a few hours time 2017 is gone and dusted. It was just like yesterday when 2016 passed the baton to 2017 and 2017 is likewise passing the baton to 2018.

It is already a known fact that today marks the last day of the year 2017; a day at which the journey of 365 days comes to an end, a day of thanksgiving and merriment; celebrating the successful completion of another yearly cycle. Many celebrate today with lots of festivities to come tomorrow( marking the beginning of another new year).
Yes, today is a day to celebrate yet also a day to think carefully by taking a thorough review of how the year all went. Taking into full consideration moment of strength, weakness, happiness, and sadness through the course of the year.

Do you seriously think you are the only one being fazed by that particular problem?

If you think you are the only one then I tell you-you are definitely mistaken. We are all faced with different difficulty and challenge. Every human has a particular challenge or problem they are battling with. The only difference we have as humans is we take things differently our attitude differs. Some people find comfort complaining and remaining in a particular challenge while some set of  people find seek solution to whatever challenge they are passing through

Wow. The grace of God is just sufficient enough for me. You don't know the worth of your health if you haven't visited a hospital for treatment and neither can you know the worth of your present physical condition if you haven't seen an accident. 

Just today I was given a scare of my life as I have never been a victim of road accident throughout my lifetime and neither the I witnessed a fresh road accident. 

Today I saw a broken ankle and I was scared to death. Seeing how the woman was crying in pain I was shocked that I didn't even remember I was in the middle of the road not until I heard the honk of another passing vehicle.

Our choice of friends goes a long way in depicting who we are. Yes, I'm not a kind of person that has lots of friends but I tell you with the few I have I'm comfortable. Personally, I'm a moralist who detests everything that looks or sounds immoral. Though most of those things I see as immoral are just based on my upbringing and experience with people. You might want to see me has been sanctimonious but I tell you I'm not. My love for morality has caused me to have just a few friends who I spend most of my time with now.

I don't like to be depressed either do I like people around me to be. A few friend can testify that I can be stupidly stupid just to get that laughter out of you.

A decision is a Topic to be concerned with... I won't want to go by my Mum Words because she uses to say.

Actually, what she meant by that is that decision is something that needed to be treated solely with much deliberation on it....

I see people write about success, write about what it takes to be successful, explaining what we all need to climb that ladder but fail to discuss what it actually takes to remain at the peak of success. We all want to be at that peak. Yes, who does not like to be on top? The view on top is quite beautiful, the top is filled with opportunity but the fact is we don't all have what it takes to remain at the top. 

Climbing a step-wise ladder to success is not easy as it takes lots of plans, hard work, commitment, perseverance, and patience to climb all through to the top but I tell you maintaining your stand at the top is far more tedious than getting to the top. Taking a look at it from this point of view; it is quite difficult running up a hill but the race becomes easy running down the hill.

We all want to be rich, we all want to make money, we all long to live a life of comfort. 
Now the questions are:
**Can we all be rich?**
**Is money really comfort?**

Taking a look at the first question;

 # Can we all be rich?

It is virtually impossible for everyone to be rich. Yes, we all have different Background, Thinking, Hunger, Opportunity, and Attitude.

### Background

Taking Background into consideration, we all come from different family; the noble family, a wealthy family, and a poor family. Your family of origin might be a considering factor to depict if you are going to be rich or not. I'm not saying you can't be rich if you are not from a well to do family, all I'm saying is it is easier to be rich if you are from a family that is wealthy.

As this saying goes

Since I joined Steemit a few months ago I've become more of a nocturnal person sleeping late and waking up early just to connect and monitor the response on my blog. 

 As we all know having a very good sleep pattern is of great importance to our health and our mind. Today I will walk you through sleeping taking some important benefits of having an adequate sleep.

Good morning great people. Trust you all had a lovely night rest. Today I will be taking you through life again.

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about life so you shouldn't be too surprised most of my blogs recently is basically about ethics that can improve our lives.

This is a saying in Yoruba(an ethnic group in Nigeria) that simply means ""life is simple"" but before I continue this write-up I will like to ask a question I think you should ponder deeply about before answering;
**Is life really simple?**

Hard work is the basis of everything worthwhile you can achieve. You might be a dreamer, you might have lots of ideas, you might be well talented but I tell you dreams, idea, and even talent can be a waste without hard work. It is just the foundation of every successful person. Hard work is that one thing every successful person have in common. 

# Talent And Hard work

Like I earlier said talent is a waste without working hard. But before I start comparing hard work with a talent I will like to write briefly on talent.

Talent is a natural skill set for a person to perform a particular task. It is a gift a person is born with.

After focusing my mind on that music for some time I was able to pick up some lyrics from the song that got me thinking. 

Though the song is in Yoruba( a language in Nigeria) it contains great information. The lyrics I could pick were;

> Kosi ogbon tole da 
Kosi iwa to le wu 
Ko sono to le mo
To le fi taye lorun o
Which simply means you can't satisfy human.

In the music, the musician told a story of a man, his son and his donkey.  The story goes thus:

> Once upon a time a man, and his son set on a journey with his donkey. The man as an old man rode on his donkey with his son walking along the way.

A friend sent me this quote this evening and it got me thinking. It took me some time to digest this quote, after some brainstorming I think I got the message @double-a is trying to pass across.

> Don't sow your bread

**Why would you sow a bread at the first instance?**

> The word **""sow""** according to the dictionary simply means **To scatter, disperse, or plant (seeds).**

A person who is in a normal state of mind will rather eat a bread than sowing a bread but at times we as humans we spend more effort on things that will end up not been productive for us, we waste our time and resources on things that won't help us progress rather than sowing a seed that will sprout fruit, we sow bread that is supposed to be eating.

The road to success is a gradual one,  but if you can speed it up, then do it!!!

Today, I'm not getting things right, not that I'm insane and I wasn't given any difficult task either, but just a little bit depressed, which was caused by my neighbor interpretation of promotion quote, 

 >> Time is in Everything.

What makes this woman rejected her son double promotion is what I was surprised about before walking up to her, but on getting there, I didn't take 5secs before I asked her, Ma, please why did you decide not to allow your son double promotion?, but I got the reply that; Time is in E","{""links"":[],""image"":[""https://img.esteem.ws/cmvujbm94p.jpg"",""https://img.esteem.ws/9nlisphu9k.jpg""],""users"":[""harbysco""],""tags"":[""motivation"",""writing"",""life"",""nigeria"",""africa""],""app"":""esteem/1.4.6"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""community"":""esteem""}",2017-09-18 09:08:45,Take Your Chance; Time is Everything.,/motivation/@harbysco/take-your-chance-time-is-everything-2017918t1083898z,5

Finally Ladoke Akintola University of Technology(LAUTECH) has resumed after a strike of 1year and 3months. The strike started with a mail and it is ending with a mail. June 9, 2016 the institution management sent a mail to the student and staff web mail which stated the institution is on break. A break in turn became a long strike action that has displaced over 30000 students across the country. The Students of LAUTECH(myself inclusive) has now been recalled to school just yesterday after a year and three months of  strike action.

> “Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.” – Harriet Tubman

It is good to dream and indeed the future belongs to those who can dream. As a child we all have our dreams, and growing up we have lots of things that we so desire. We are all dreamers and we all have the strength to pursue our dreams. ~~Yes I said it~~, the strength is within us but not everybody believes in their dreams, asides believing not everyone is willing to pursue their dreams

Taking a look at life before Steemit, I was a ~~rich~~ but poor Nigerian student who has lost everything to ponzi schemes(a Nigerian will understand better). 

I got to know of Steemit at a point in time when I was down and depressed; I have lost every of my hard earned money to High Yield Investment Programs(HYIP), my institution(LAUTECH) has been on strike for over a year, languishing in loneliness, having problems putting my constructive mind to better use, with frustration beginning to set in, a time when I was pissed and angry with everything around me, a time when I was so damn broke.

Thanks to @gbenga I got to know of Steemit after calling to lend some cash from a dear friend. He told me about a platform where I can vote, blog and earn. With the thought of earning, I did some digging and eventually signed up on Steemit.

The idea is to help as much Ladokites as possible, as we pass through this time of turbulence(strike actions).

The LAUTECH STEEMIT COMMUNITY idea has been a success so far since we now have 23 Students of LAUTECH on Steemit with around 11 users still waiting to be authenticated. Some users has been able to write their introductory post while some has gone ahead and authored over 4-5 blogs.

Nigeria is a developing third world country faced with lots of economical challenge. As a trait to most African countries we are faced with the issue of management and poor leadership. Like I have always said Africa is blessed yet also cursed with the type of leaders ruling over African countries. I'm not here to talk about our leaders today since I've grown sick and tired of complaining and whining over their faults. 

As a Nigerian or an African, seeing the inability of our government to provide and cater for the citizens, we have resulted to taking care of ourselves, we have resulted to enpowering ourselves. With the increased use of internet in Africa over the years, Africans has been able to tap into the vast ocean of opportunities on the internet with lot of African earning and catering for themselves with the use of the internet.

As a newbie on Steemit, after finally signing up my Steemit account, I clicked on the wallet button knowing wallet holds money. On the wallet button l saw Steem, Steem Power of which I found +27.658 beneath it and finally Steem Dollars. This variety of currencies got me confused since I could not differentiate which of the currencies I will be earning with. I know of Steem since I saw it on coinmarketcap, I know it's a cryptocurrency just like bitcoin and ethereum but I found it difficult differentiating Steem Power from Steem Dollar.

The beauty of life is you enjoying every moment of it.

 **Why stay sad when you can be happy?**

**Why cry when you can smile?**

**Is that problem seeming difficult?**

Life is filled with ups and downs, at times you be at the receiving end of the ups and other times you get the downs which is why life is not a bed of roses nor a bed of thorns. 

Do you feel sad when everything is working perfectly for you? I doubt it. If you don't  feel unhappy when life is treating you fairly then you shouldn't feel sad when its not so fair. You should always realize that during your stinct of happiness someone somewhere is sad since life is more like the earth revolving round the sun; you get the bright side(day) while others gets the dark side(night). Therefore always try to stay happy seeing the brighter side of things at all time.

> "" we have to learn from animals than animals have to learn from us"" - Anthony Douglas Williams.

As humans we learn new things everyday either consciously or unconsciously. Taking a close look at how coherent termites are, I learnt and understood the essence of teamwork. This little organisms sets a specific goal to all survive and proliferate. These goals are carried out as a team which in the course of protecting and surviving are able to build a gigantic mound. If this little organisms can build a mound then come to think of what humans can achieve if we face a set goal collectively. No wonder great enterprise has begun with at least a team of two people. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft.

We keep yearning for more as we get that particular thing we once wanted i.e. Our wants change as a particular want is fulfilled. Take for instance a person walking bare footed on getting a pair of shoes will like to have two pairs of shoe. This same person will like to have dozens of clothes if gotten the pairs of two shoe, That's Human for you!!!

##### This unending wants of human make us less appreciative of what we have. It is always good to yearn for more because this unending want has brought about development in every facet of life just in a bid to want a better version of a particular thing, yet it is crucial to always appreciate and make use of what you have.

Over 90% of people on Steemit joined the platform based on the sole fact that the platform rewards for voting and blogging thus the motto **Vote, Blog and Earn**. We fail to realize Steemit is not a get rich fast platform.

Yes, It is a platform that rewards you for your creativity yet it's a platform that pays more for your hard work. The truth be told the community is now far more than just vote, blog and earn because Steemit is no longer a pond with few fishes, it is now more like an ocean with an enormous amount of fishes. The sooner we realize this the better.

As a newbie on Steemit finding our way on Steemit can be very challenging without having a prior knowledge of the use of Markdown or The Editor writing style. As a newbie myself, my first posts on Steemit were messy and not properly arranged asterisks I didn't understand the use of the Editor and Markdown writing style. But after spending some time with @gbenga who taught me the use of Markdown writing guide which I think I prefer over the use of Editor the quality and arrangement of my blogs has improved remarkably.

Considering these fact that I had issues while starting up on Steemit, I have compiled a video and table on the use of Basic Markdown Styling Guide in this post. Hopefully, it will get you started as a newbie here in Steemit.

We are all filled with ideas but a major difference between Outstanding people and common people is their ability to take necessary actions when these ideas are birthed. On having a new idea, our mind focuses better on that particular idea for a period of time in which we lose focus after some time with our mind processing different information.

Peculiar people take immediate action on an idea conceived these actions makes them what they are, it makes them different from the common people who just keep postponing the use of these conceived ideas. Considering these, I was inspired to discuss procrastination on my blog today

In one of my [recent post](https://steemit.com/contest/@harbysco/my-journey-on-steemit-summit-on-gbenga-steemit-virus-contest) i stated my Steemit goals. Considering the proverb that says **""a journey of a thousand miles begin with a single step""**, i have taken my first step to bringing these said goals into fruition by taking a trip down to Ogbomoso, Oyo State Nigeria where i will be introducing LAUTECH(Ladoke Akintola University of Technology) students to the platform.

My journey to Ogbomoso was not as i anticipated since i was held in traffic at the Lagos-Ibadan expressway for 2hrs thus prolonging the duration of the journey.

Here are some photos of the journey

Complaint is an innate characteristics of man. It is in human nature to complain over everything. We mostly complain about the state of the economy, how unfair and unjust the government is because it is quite an easy way of letting our anger out when things are not going our way. But before complaining, we should ask ourselves some questions like:
**How have i contributed to the development of these community/country?**
**What plans do i have to make the world a better place?**
**What will i do if i am given a position of power or in a position to help others?**

Health is worth more than wealth and having a sound health is of great essence to our life. A good feeding habit and daily physical activity are ways to improving our health.
> Don't focus on how much you eat focus on what you eat- Food matters

The food we eat goes a long way in promoting our health status. Therefore taking foods and fruits containing vitamins and essential supplements are key to living a healthy lifestyle.

In this blog, i will be discussing a fruit that is of great value to our health.

##### Here is my summit on the [Steemit Virus Contest](https://steemit.com/growth-ideas/@gbenga/steemit-virus-contest-1-giving-back-to-the-steemit-community) by @gbenga where I'm to discuss basically my journey on Steemit. But before i begin my tale, i will like to appreciate @gbenga for this wonderful and very creative initiative. 

##### I entered this contest seeing an opportunity to share my journey on Steemit and also to appreciate everyone that has contributed to my success in this community. I've actually thought on writing an appreciation blog to the brains behind [Project Bigwave](https://steemit.com/curation/@fisteganos/announcing-project-bigwaves-curation-for-the-nigerian-community) but with this contest I can kill two birds with a stone.

The World is blessed with lots of cultures and traditions. With each culture having it's own myths and beliefs. Africa is a continent that is very rich in cultural heritage passed from generation to generation. The richness in African's culture is arguably as a result of our proximity to nature.

 Prior to Western civilization, most African countries believed in different mystical power in form of deities or gods that are worshipped and appeased. Just as Ancient Greek worshipped Poseidon, Ares, Zeus, Hades, Apollo and the likes Africans also worship different gods and these gods are believed to govern the affairs of the World.

Owing to the fact that I'm yet to cross my country's borders, I will be restricting this topic of discussion to one of the major ethnic group in Nigeria; The Yorubas.

As a person that lives in a rural area is more apt to seeing the beauty of nature, taking a look around me i saw the diversity of nature ranging from the difference in patterns of plant leaves to the variance in the chirps and shrieks of birds.

Nature is so diverse that it is made up of plants animals and the microscopic world of microorganisms(considering it biotically) all showing different diversity as a function of their character.

Unemployment is one of the major challenges facing the World's economy presently. An unemployed person is someone who is capable of working and is actively in search of job but unable to secure one. Increase in unemployment rate of a nation results to financial crisis therefore resulting in the reduction of a nation's overall purchasing power which in turn results in poverty. Although unemployment is a global challenge, it is deeply rooted in African nations.
The unemployment rate in Africa is alarming with countries like Kenya yielding a new high rate of 39.1%, Ghana where 48% of 15-24 year old are unemployed and countries in Subsaharan Africa has a youth unemployment rate of 12%.

Childhood is the first stage of life, a learning stage where you have no worries of what is to come , a stage where you love almost everything around you without being able to differentiate what is good from what's bad. My days as a child are my greatest memories. Although to some people childhood might be full of unpleasant memories probably owing to the fact that they have been abused or maltreated one way or the other as a child. As much as i will like to write about child abuse, it's not a topic for today since i will like to share some of my funfilled memories as a child.

**Why the struggle for power when we can be united?**

**Why let our belief and religions divide us?**

> Once upon a time, an old man lived with his three sons in a village. The three sons were hard workers. Still, they quarrelled all the time. The old man tried a lot to unite them but he failed. Though the villagers appreciated their hard work and efforts, they made fun of them on their fights.
Months passed by and the old man fell sick. He told his sons to stay united, but they didn’t listen to him. So, he decided to teach them a practical lesson so that they would forget their differences and stay united.

Global warming is the term used to describe a gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth thereby changing the Earth's climate. Scientific research on climate change related to global warming reports that the average temperature of the Earth has increased between 0.4°c and 0.8°c in 100 years. 
The primary cause of global warming is as a result of human activities like deforestation and burning of fossil fuels leading to an increased emission of green house gases like carbondioxide, CFC, methane, nitrous oxide, and tropospheric oxide. The long term effects of  global warming may include a rise in sea level due to melting of polar ice caps l,reduced crop production due to harsh weather, and increased  storm occurrence and severity. 
With all these being said about gloval warming, the World has taken a huge step in the pursuit to maintain the Earth's temperature.

One of my friend @epikcoin wrote on his post [Success = persistence+mistake](https://steemit.com/esteem/@epikcoin/success-mistakes-persistence-2017710t17714902z) and i also wrote in my post yesterday on persistence. Persistence simply means the fact of continuing in an opinion or cause of action inspite of difficulty or challenges. Your level of success is determined by your level of persistence. Success and persistence works  hand in hand, without persistence success cannot be attained. Being successful is a measure of your persistence. There are several challenges on the road to success,challenges like **failure** ,and **disappointment** but conquering these challenges depends on how persistent you are. Persistence is a key in achieving your set goal.

**Are you beginning to get frustrated?**
**Are you thinking of quitting?**
**If you are,don't quit because winners never quit**.

To newbies steemit might get very frustrating when you write a blog that you think should earn you more upvotes and you are not getting enough upvotes and comments you desire. I'm telling you this because i have been there and i'm still presently there. I have thought of quitting so many times but seeing blogs having a reasonable amount of upvotes and comment showed me a brighter side,made me believe my upvotes can get better, people can actually show interest in my post by commenting but all this can't be accomplished if i quit.

Cats are one of the most domesticated animals around the world with over 36million household  ownership in the United State of America alone. Cats are often valued by human as companion because of their ability to hunt vermin. Cats have similar anatomy when compared with other felids,with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, teeth adapted for killing small preys, and sharp retractable claws.
Cats have a population pf over 500million through out the world and are more common pets associated with women, report in 2007 by [Gallup poll](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup_(company)#Gallup_Poll) reported that men and women in the United State of America are equally likely to own a cat.

I should be on bed by now but i can't bear the thought of not reading the post of my cybertherapist tonight not less posting my comment.
Why hasn't she  posted today? Owing to the fact that she blogs around this time.I have been refreshing my feed for her blog for the past 1hr yet nothing has popped up.

I don't get obsessed with things easily but i think @kaylinart post on motivation and self improvement is lit.

Maybe i should share one of her post with you guys.

To  me my greatest fear has always been dynamic, changing as i grew older.As a kid, i was fearless probably owing to the fact that i can't really  differentiate what is right from wrong but as i grew older my fear is being insignificant amidst my peer(can't stand the thought of it) and being errant in my decision making because i  believe the greatest power that can be wielded  by man is the  power to make decisions and the decisions we make depicts who we are.

The two best football team in Spain and arguably the two best football team in the world faced off yesterday in a thrilling encounter at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. The Stadium was filled to the brim as usual with many football fans outside the stadium glued to their TV sets to watch the prestigious football rivalry. The match kicked off at about 8:45 pm WAT with high intensity, both sides battling each other to emerge winners after just three days where Barcelona was able to knock out their arch rival in the Copa Del Rey to proceed to their record sixth consecutive Copa Del Rey Final.

Waking up this morning having my quiet time, drowning in my pool of thought the question above popped up in my mind and since then I have been trying to answer the question. Ruminating on the question all I could come up with is there is no laid down path to success of which I will like to justify in this brief write up.

It sometimes amazes me when I see people trying to be a character successful author has laid down in their books. I'm not saying reading books is bad or incorporating one or two idea derived from reading into your way of life is bad all I am trying to point out is you can't keep living your life because some people has lived their life that way and turned out to be successful.

Risen with hopes
Expectations aloud
What a NIGHT!!

>While i stretch out
A sight to the window pane
Shows the clouded sky
What a NIGHT!!

>the fluffy cloud
With irregular forms
I felt the void
What a NIGHT!!

>I rise from absense
A temporary rest 
With energies for LIVE
What a NIGHT!!
