           Uranus was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel, an amateur astronomer, using a home-made telescope. At first he thought he had found a comet.   The diameter of Uranus is 51,000 km. It's day is about 17 hours long, and it takes 84 Earth years to travel round the sun.  
             ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/3lowssl0br.jpg). 
   â€¢ Uranus is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium. The gas methane is also present in its atmosphere, which makes Uranus look green from Earth. 
  â€¢ until 1986, only nine rings had been counted round Uranus. On its fly-past however, voyager 2 found four more rings, making 13 in all. 
                   Uranus' satellites
   Uranus has 15 satellites altogether. The five main ones are Miranda, Ariel, umbriel, Titania and Oberon. The largest, oberon and Titania, are about 1500 km across. 
â€¢ Uranus spins on its side instead of almost upright,like the other planets. Because of this, the poles of the planet can sometimes face the sun. When this happens, they are warmer than the planet,s equator!  
  â€¢ Uranus' small satellite Miranda may have been shattered in a collision with another body. It seems to have broken up into large pieces which collected together again.","{""links"":[],""image"":[""https://img.esteem.ws/3lowssl0br.jpg""],""tags"":[""steemstem"",""history"",""beyondbitcoin"",""nigeria"",""writing""],""app"":""esteem/1.6.0"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""community"":""esteem""}",2018-08-28 09:27:06.000,Uranus,/steemstem/@bolajija/uranus-f43872d217fca,0

 â€¢ wind power : electricity can be generated by using windmills that turn simply by the power of the wind.  
  â€¢ water power : experiments are taking place to find out how to use the power of the world's oceans and rivers to produce electricity 
 â€¢ New fuels: these can be made from tiny algae plant, from alcohol, and even from animal drug.  ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/y4z6fi23nb.jpg)
â€¢ solar power: the sun's rays can be used to produce power on earth 
â€¢ Nuclear fusion: by joining atoms together, enormous amounts of power could be generated. This would be safer than the atomic power in use now.","{""links"":[],""image"":[""https://img.esteem.ws/y4z6fi23nb.jpg""],""tags"":[""thefuture"",""wafrica"",""nigeria"",""naijapidgin"",""blog""],""app"":""esteem/1.6.0"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""community"":""esteem""}",2018-11-20 05:48:30.000,New sources of power,/thefuture/@bolajija/new-sources-of-power-c7cf19b37d7ce,2

  â€¢ The flat part on either side of the quill is called the vane. It is made from tiny fibers called barbs. There are about 600 barbs on either side, each carrying smaller offshoots. All the barbs and offshoots are locked tightly together by hooks to make a smooth surface.
