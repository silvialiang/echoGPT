>Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things. - Steve Jobs.

Everyone knows this and we quote it every once in a while. It is however ironic that there is so little love in the world.
The idea of love has been so twisted in our world that what we mostly refer to as love is selfish interest.

There used to be a time when philanthropy was a noble venture. Now, it’s no longer so. Many people give, not out of love but as a way to reiterate their superiority and in excahge, they demand that their feet be kissed.

Leaders do not understand the sacrifice that goes hand-in-hand with their position. They now see it as the appropriate platform to unleash oppression.

Love is a verb. It’s an action word. It’s going beyond the feeling of pity and taking action.
Valentine’s day is not the day to celebrate love.

After reading @gbenga 's post, if you still have issues, it's simple.
>1. You get a loan and invest in steemit
>2. You decide to do better by looking at other tags on steemit such as utopian-io or steemit-virus not or steemstem or try out contests to see if you can make decent earnings
>3. Quit steemit altogether

I saw from @gbenga 's post  that he barely gets a good night rest and then it still seems like he's done nothing.

Immediately the trucked passed in the opposite direction, someone in my vehicle said, “Slave mentality.”
Another passenger asked him why he said that and in reply, he explained that because the men in front where white and the ones behind were black, the white men must be racist.
“It is only in this country, you’ll see where a white man is oppressing a black man on his own land,” he said. Some of the passengers nodded in agreement and I was puzzled.

Here are the five things we learnt from Nigeria's international friendly win against Argentina, as we make preparations for Russia 2018 World Cup Finals.
Although, some would want to argue it was just a friendly and it doesn't ""hold much water"" or signify that the Nigerian National team are making the much needed progress tactically or simply disagree that it'd be an entirely different ballgame if Messi had played. I think a visibly upset Sampoli, the Argentine Coach, who had gone into the game unbeaten would argue with that assertion, as the Super Eagles came from two(2) goals down to defeat La Albiceleste, without Victor Moses and some of our other major players.

I've compiled a list of smart questions you should ask at the end of any job interview to improve your chances of landing not just any job, but your dream job. The essence of these smart questions are to present you to the interviewer as someone who is really interested in the job position and not just someone who is frustrated of staying at home and would do just any job to make ends meet.

Today I feel happy as I got a little delegation from @gbenga to enable me to vote on comments and posts, so I can add more value to the community. 

Having a high steem power (SP)is beneficial as it helps increases the curation reward of the steemian that voted. Steem power is a major investment on to every steemian.

## INTRODUCING THE STEEMIT VIRUS AGAIN
The steemit virus is an initiative of @gbenga. The Steemit virus campaign is a project that is visioned at growing the steemit community and steemians generally. This campaign was birthed two months ago with the goal of bringing new steemians and helping them grow. 

#### The poor standard of living in the third world countries and other parts of the world has been a major hiccup.

Why must I suffer things I know nothing about,why do I have such wicked destiny?
Orisala you are wicked,you can't even save me? Please ""Orisala help me this once remember I always give you sacrifice please help me out.
I was still crying while the king stepped out. I was asked to follow him as I saw mother too,she ran to me and saying Adekunle let's run out and escape this place now.

Run out and escape? Yes Adekunle,that's exactly what I want,of course mother,let's go.
As we were about stepping out of the palace I looked back and saw BOLANLE and the other mountain goddess with the king.

I couldn't believe this,mother what's going on now? 

Adekunle I couldn't fulfill all my promises to Awele,I have made the decision of allowing you to move near the throne. Please forgive me.

You know to every friendship is an agreement, I and fijabi told Awele we will think about it and we departed that day. 
After she left fijabi came to me comforting me and that all will be well and not so long I accepted to follow the plan. Awele's pregnancy was just three month so it was easy for me to go on with the plan. 

As time moves on,the due date approached and we planned to give birth on the same day,Awele kept on saying if she dies I should take care of her baby and even if she doesn't I am going to be the one to take care of the baby.So that night Awele was to deliver outside the palace as she requested from the king. She did this because of the plan we had.

You know Awele is the queen and whenever we moved out three or four guards are always with us guarding from afar. So it was easy to send the woman off.'

Awele turned to me and asked us to head back home,we both look confused probably because we know something is true about what the woman said. That so woman actually said Awele will be the queen few years ago and here is she now the queen of Agunola's village.

So as we both walked back towards the palace Awele turned to me, Abeke she called,yes my Lady. I need to make a plan with you and fijabi,let's go back to your house and we can chat and make the plans together,so we turned back and headed home to meet fijabi.

As we got home,we met fijabi sitting out in the compound relaxing,he saw us coming and call out Awele's name, Awele Awele Awele Ayaba,we all laughed out loudly as we sat down to plan things out.

 After sending my lantern lamp off,I told mother am heading home first because I actually felt odd amidst the people,a lot of people kept on staring ar me,so I headed home that night without mother as I kept on thinking of the past while walking home.

Out here is the new moon slightly shinning brightly,the thought of how I and that lady used to sit and watch the new moon under the old tall palm tree was all I could ever think of. Now it is time for the fetish right to be performed, it is believed that making sacrifice to the gods of the land will bring prosperity and success to the land,so every new moon is a call for fetish rights and sacrifice. It is to be done by the King who is to move round the town sprinkling the blood of a new born goat on the ground as he moves about,thus it serves as an avenue to see the king once every year.

As I opened the door the woman looks at me surprisingly and asked me of my name,oh! My name?

Agunola village is a small village of about sixty houses, surrounded with rivers and forest and one tall mountain called AGUNLA the Agunla mountain.is of about 2000metres high above as it looks as if it is reaching out there for the blue sky,the mountain is covered with a rug of trees, green, yellow, but her bare tops is scarfed and beribboned and it looks so cloudy. The village is said to be named after the mountain as history have it,some said there are mountain spirit inside and some said there are living humans in the mountain but no one really knows the mysterious story behind it and no one dares move towards it.Agunola has a palace with twenty rooms in it and you can see guards patrolling it day and night without resting, that's where the king of the land resides. Farming is the major occupation of the people and the village is well know for their Palm oil production.

Woody woody chopper,
Axe has strong as balls,
Arms has brave as bravo,
It never misses a hit,
Directly on axis,
It falls into the sea causing a big splash!
Sea water on wood chopper's face,
Yells in trouble,
Pulls off his jacket to clean eyes,
Scratching uncontrollably,
Is sea angry at my dear wood chopper?
Or tree is malicious?
He leaves for home,
Calls sick,
Next day,
Seen with a swollen buggy eye ball.

Not everyone is able to have good food, in fact, so many people cannot afford to eat twice daily. So many people are homeless, some are not even privileged to know their parents and are not opportune to have formal education.

We gave out lots of prizes and left a lot of people very happy this year..

We are proud and grateful at the same time. We want to make 2018 an even bigger year of the **VIRUS**. We need your support..

We would like to conduct a survey on your thoughts about the *STEEMIT VIRUS* contest and eventually use the feedback gathered to effect the planning for the *Virus creativity* contests in 2018.

Backstage, we already have big plans to do even greater works and this is what makes us even more happy.

1. The Selection of Poems: 
The success of any poetry lesson depends to a large extent on the poem chosen for study. For this reason, teachers must choose their poems with care. The following are important considerations;
- the subject matter has to be fascinating or appealing to the pupil so they can show gr at interest in the lesson.
- the situation(s) which atise should be within the pupils experience to garner their interest.
- language may be a difficulty even when the subject matter and situation(s) are within the pupils scopes, if the language is beyond their scope.
- style of writing, the language refers to the words or phrases used, style is the manner in which the words are used. A clumsy approach or an obscure style creates difficulty and should be avoided.
Therefore, poem to be read in class should have an attractive subject matter, describe range within the pupils scopes, be written in simple language and adopt an easy to understand approach ","{""tags"":[""steemit-education"",""poetry"",""steemit-writer"",""africa"",""nigeria""],""users"":[""joecxt""],""image"":[""https://i.pinimg.com/736x/79/d5/4d/79d54d6f33fca68523f38cefacd13b8d--writing-poetry-teaching-poetry.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmcGTgE9ztQ7QmWESyE7uVqLrUqfbAa1fsTCod6dmsFYjP/DQmcGTgE9ztQ7QmWESyE7uVqLrUqfbAa1fsTCod6dmsFYjP.gif"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmWaeELKbSBTzovcg9kb2Fh8Qy5eTcZAPFBa7A2KPS2U6U/DQmPRJZcvCKDA77UPNaeoB77TViyozeaTzvZ3zLn3Es5k4J_1680x8400.png""],""links"":[""https://i.pinimg.com/736x/79/d5/4d/79d54d6f33fca68523f38cefacd13b8d--writing-poetry-teaching-poetry.jpg""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-12-21 23:50:09,Broad Principles Of Poetry 2,/steemit-education/@steemit-virus/broad-principles-of-poetry-2,2

To be able to teach poetry successfully, a teacher must know a couple of these principles by heart and know what they mean.
These principles cover not only the type of poem to be studied but also what the teacher's attitude to poetry should be and how poetry should be taught generally.
It is important that the teacher should fully understand these basic principles, otherwise, (s)he may find these his/her teaching(s) falling short of the ideal.

it's the first time she'd made a decision by her self and all she needed was your support. She wanted to be an architect but as usual, you countered it and gave her your final verdict that she had to be a Doctor or Nothing else. 

She was a bright child afterall, atleast that explains why she was able to push through the traumatic experience of not living her dreams to getting a degree for you. 

Like fate was smiling at her, a man of her dreams came along her path to free her off your clench. 

But as usual, you had other plans, 'YOU WILL MARRY THE MAN I CHOOSE' was the last thing you said before dashing out, not even considering the ocean that forced their way through her eyes.

>_""Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.""_
-- Henry David Thoreau

The popular saying of ""good things come to those who wait"" has been largely understood by lots and lots of people who interpret ""those who wait"" as ""those who sit on their ass all day and do nothing"" while I believe and I may be wrong at that but, I believe it refers to those who have put in the right amount of skill to their craft or discipline and also developed themselves but are working hard still and **waiting** for the big break..

Good things doesn't come to those who have done nothing to deserve the good things and are waiting for it, good things come to those who have actively searched for the good by building up themselves to be able to use the good and turn them to even better things when the good things arrive.

You can't succeed in whatever you are doing if you do not home your skills towards that and ","{""tags"":[""motivation"",""success-drive"",""life"",""nigeria"",""africa""],""users"":[""joecxt""],""image"":[""http://www.seekers-ultimate-no-bullshit-guide-to-life.net/wp-content/uploads/CQBpBz_W8AAtJN5.jpg"",""https://i.pinimg.com/736x/90/e9/8b/90e98bcdf5f461936ae5f3143db0cde1--motivational-quotes-for-women-short-inspirational-quotes.jpg"",""http://www.motivationblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Hunger-for-Success.jpg"",""https://s7.postimg.org/610zinmaz/IMG_20171215_073632.jpg"",""https://www.rafanadaltour.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/e388330d470dbec4d4f3d583a460d37d.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmcGTgE9ztQ7QmWESyE7uVqLrUqfbAa1fsTCod6dmsFYjP/DQmcGTgE9ztQ7QmWESyE7uVqLrUqfbAa1fsTCod6dmsFYjP.gif"",""https://steemit-production-imageproxy-thumbnail.s3.amazonaws.com/DQmPRJZcvCKDA77UPNaeoB77TViyozeaTzvZ3zLn3Es5k4J_1680x8400.jpg""],""links"":[""http://www.seekers-ultimate-no-bullshit-guide-to-life.net/wp-content/uploads/CQBpBz_W8AAtJN5.jpg"",""https://i.pinimg.com/736x/90/e9/8b/90e98bcdf5f461936ae5f3143db0cde1--motivational-quotes-f",2017-12-15 06:43:33,You Can't Stay Hungry And Not Succeed.

steemit-virus,english-tutorial-extracts-from-the-elements-of-style,"English Tutorial. Extracts from ""The Elements of Style""",steemit-writer,"# Elementary Rules of Usage 
1. Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's. 
Follow this rule whatever the final consonant. Thus write, 
>Charles's friend 
Burns's poems 
the witch's malice 

**Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names ending in -es and -is, the 
possessive Jesus', and such forms as for conscience' sake, for righteousness' sake.**
But such forms as Moses' Laws, Isis' temple are 
commonly replaced by 
>the laws of Moses 
the temple of Isis 

### The pronominal possessives hers, its, theirs, yours, and ours have no apostrophe.
Indefinite pronouns, however, use the apostrophe to show possession. one's rights  somebody else's umbrella 

### A common error is to write it's for its, or vice versa. 
The first is a contraction, meaning ""it is."" The second is a possessive. 

It's a wise dog that scratches its own fleas.

I tweaked that popular saying right? And you may not agree with me on it but allow me explain...

Alex was a well established stock trader, beautiful family, successful trades on a roll, a beautiful house close with a well trimmed garden and an exotic view of the ocean. It all seemed to be going so well for Alex. He had nice cars, all latest editions of his favored Chevys.
He could easily afford the vest schools for his kids and the best locations for family and personal vacations.

### Alex was living the life
___

His friends from the hood were always wishing they could live like Alex while a few others were always jealous of his life and otherwise praying for a down fall or a turn off fortunes for bad for Alex.

Well.. one day, their wishes for a downturn happened..

>Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things. - Steve Jobs.

steemit-virus,when-your-life-is-at-a-pause-it-doesn-t-spell-the-end-of-the-world,"When your life is at a pause, it doesn't spell the end of the world..",motivation,"## An idle mind they say, is the devil’s workshop.

Most of our adult life is usually spent working and trying to make ends meet. It is a joy to have something that keeps you gainfully employed. 
_By gainfully, I mean doing something you enjoy that pays the bills as well._

Often after university, people begin to ask you, “What do you do now? Have you gotten a job? Are you starting a business?” and so on. It is often a delight to be able to reply these questions in the affirmative.
It feels good to tell your friends you’ve gotten a good job or that business is booming.

**However, there are periods of pauses in our lives. How do we deal with them?**
I used to see myself as ‘late’. I didn’t get into the university immediately like most of my friends, I didn’t graduate with most of my friends and I didn’t go for service the same time they did.

When I look back however, I realized that I made good use of some of those pauses and with some, I could have done better.
