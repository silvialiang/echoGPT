There had been a war in Otto village where Biba once lived happily with her parents, but the terrible massacre of men, women and children had not spared her parents. How she survived the war had been a miracle. 

Her uncle had come to bring her home with him when he heard of her survival. Mide wanted his wife to take the child and treat her like she did to her own, but Bose couldn't bring herself to do that, what she perceived her as a child coming to share her husband's love, care and property with her children.

But they had three children who loved Mide very well and shared things together. Remi , his oldest son, was fifteen years old and tinuke his first daughter was thirteen years.

Biba's exemplary performance in school the previous school term, made Mide live up to his promise; he took the child along with him to the New Yam festival. Bose was furious about this. Why would Mide choose Biba over their daughter? But Tinuke had performed poorly and Mide promised to take only the child who did brilliantly well.

When Mide fulfilled his promise and went to the festival with his niece, Bose raged all day. She thought to herself. It was time to get rid of the bastard her husband had brought home. She had to act fast or Biba would steal the love of her children from their father's heart.

Tinuke cried all day, she really wanted to attend and experience the festival but her father had taken Biba instead. Her mother was right, Biba must be a little witch. She was ready to do everything her mother instructed her to do in order tomake Biba's life a miserable hell.

But they had three children who loved Mide very well and shared things together. Remi , his oldest son, was fifteen years old and Tinuke his first daughter was thirteen years. Tobi, his last son was the same age with Bida, his niece, they were both twelve years old.

Remi couldn't care less about his young cousin who moved in with them. Biba was much younger and they possibly couldn't have anything together. He didn't support his mother's maliciousness towards Biba either. It was his sister Tinuke, who shared the same hatred with their mother.

Tinuke thought her dad dotted too much on Bida. Her mother had warned her never to have anything with the bastard. She was told never to see her like a sister or friend, rather to see her as an enemy and since then she despised her cousin and treated her like dirt.

Tobi on the other hand was just like his father. He loved all his siblings and his cousin alike.

Bose hatred for her husband's niece grew as each day went by. After the child's parents passed on and she was brought in to live with family, Bose became jealous of her husband's love and attraction for his late brother's daughter. 

She couldn't understand why her husband treated their children and his orphan niece alike.Sometimes she thought she sensed her husband's preferential treatment for Biba above the other children.

Bose once confronted her husband, Mide, but Mide didn't see anything wrong with taking good care of his late brother's daughter and sending her to school along with his own children. 

His brother would have done the same in his shoes; more so, he didn't like to see young Biba grieve more than she alredy did. He just wanted her to be happy.

It is no longer a new thing that people ascribe hard work to being lucky mostly whenever they cannot do what you are doing.

The difference between those who take charge of their future and those who wait for their future to look for them and play the right track is noted as **LUCK**. The moment you start taking charge of your own life, dictating what you want for yourself and what you do not want, you start to experience more and more events than an average person. No other luck beats your attitude and personality towards others.

You might know someone who gets angry easily, well people who get angry often regret after they've experiences a blowup. They end up saying I'm sorry, what you will do for them is to accomodate them and let them see ways at which they can start changing by themselves and not by force.

From the book ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING, it is said that the quality of our lives is determined by the choice we make. These choices include our careers, our partners, our friends, lifestyle, and other things. You have the choice to either be happy or sad, strong or weak.

No one can make you happy, you can only decide to be happy. The only thing people can do for you is to make you laugh but you will decide either to be happu or not. If someone is making gest of you, it is your choice to either laugh about it and make yourself happy or become sad about it.

No one will make you happy

Reading through this book ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING is a very wonderful book. We all want to be happy and fulfilled though most times we set very strict with what makes us happy.

What makes us happy? When do we want to be happy? 

These attitudes are the main things that spoil relationships. When you have a particular thing that makes you happy and you demand it from partners in relationships.

> I have a natural tendency to become obsessive about things once I identify goals

There are things that are profitable and things that aren't of importance. Old tricks can't be easily left but new lessons can be learnt easily and fast addicting just as steemit is becoming addictive.

Anything I have set goals on, I start picking interest in it and soon, I start becoming engrossed in it after which it starts growing to become an obsession. I become a part of whatever I get obsessed with. The more obsessed I'm with my goal, I become obsessed with it. 

My goal is my pursuit;
It is my fuel when I'm out of energy;
My way in the wilderness;
My goal is my drive;
The only thing I don't want to loss;
My only reason for being where I'm presently.

Oh woman, you don't have to cry but just be prayerful, all will be well, the doctors said and left.

Two days later, Joecilia was discharged but when she was taken home, she was acting so terribly, she was afraid of talking to them, everything all seemed new and strange to her.
Jane and Angie always felt sad, and one day they were crying alone in the sitting room when Mrs. Lawanson came in.","{""tags"":[""royalty"",""nigeria"",""wisdom"",""love"",""africa""],""image"":[""https://img.esteem.ws/h0jqhh8vpt.jpg""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-04-08 22:47:24,The Wise Prince:13,/royalty/@steaks-info/the-wise-prince-13,1

Jane and Angie told Joecelia so many things but he started raising her voice, and this brought the attention of the doctor. The doctor asked Jane and Angie to leave her alone and the two sisters left.

Two minutes later, the doctor went to Jane, Angie and Mrs. Lwanson.
Hmmm!Joecelia cannot remember anything at all, the doctor said.
But...but.... she only had an accident, Angie said.","{""tags"":[""wisdom"",""royalty"",""love"",""nigeria"",""story""],""links"":[""https://img.esteem.ws/h0jqhh8vpt.jpg""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-04-06 08:14:03,The Wise Prince: Chapter 12,/wisdom/@steaks-info/the-wise-prince-chapter-12,0

Her sisters ran towards her, and the driver took her into the car, and they all went to the hospital.

Jane called her mother and she went to the hospital to see her daughter. Joecilia was admitted. The doctor attended to her. Joecelia finally woke up, and they all went home together.

Joecy, we are sorry we didn't know you were on the road, we are very sorry, Angie said. Who are you? sorry for what? Joecelia asked as she looked up.

It was Jane who told their mother what was happening. The woman consoled her grieving daughter.

Joecy, don't worry,  someone else will love you, Mrs. Lawson said. 
Her mother loved to see her daughter happy, so she decided to take her outside and told her many stories. But all that did not change her mood, but after three days Joecelia decided to forget about Seth. 

Mr. Quadri visited them often and was always glad to see Joecelia in her blind state. 
Stupid girl, you will remain blind forever, he said in his mind.

One day Joecelia told Angie and Jane that the house was boring, so they decided to go to the field to catch some fun. The girls held Joecelia's hands as they went.

So Joecili, I am getting married soon to a beautiful lady, but I have to admit that you are more beautiful, but I love her more.
So, girl, its over between us because I know no man will ever get married to a blind lady.
