Then, she saw a young girl walking towards her and she became very happy and hopeful. She was happy for three reasons. The first was that the girl, was the first human she was seeing since she left home.

The second was because it was obvious that they could be of the same age and the third reason was that it was going to be easy for them to communicate, understand each other and certainly become friends easily.

I realize that when you have money, it brings some other things to you, it attracts self respect, and love.

One opinion I have is that when jealousy gets too much, it has the power to ruin your relationship.Yes, it is fine to protect the person that you love and ensure that you are the only one around to make him or her happy.
But, when it becomes too much that you begin to get over protective about your partner to the extent of almost loosing it, then there is something  wrong with it.

Take time to show your family how special they are and how much they mean to you. One hard fact that we usually fail to remember or admit is that they will never be with us forever, at a point we will have to split and go our own separate ways and probably begin to make another family aside the one we use to have before.

Even during the time of a caring man's inconvenience, he tries to make himself available for you.

In whatsoever decision he wants you make, he gives room for your suggestion and holds you as being superior in every way.

In an environment like this, there is usually no strength and sanity to carry out any mental job or even to think well.

Heat rashes are caused on the body of a man at the presence of heat.

There are actually so many things that could make the life of a man miserable some of those things are maybe becoming sick constantly, loosing a partner or friend and lot of things.

Always have it at the back of your mind that when you have money in a way that is too little, it has the power to make you a miserable being.

Having too much money (I heard) can make a man become miserable, I also heard that when a man acquires too much stuff, he can potentially become a miserable being as well and if you do not have at all you could become miserable.

The only way for a man to avoid regrets at the end of his or her life is to understand the principles behind good values and to as well be able to work well with them.

In order to live a life of good values, you need to stop pleasing people and do not constantly allow them judge you for every of your action and every step you take. Your life is in no way a slave to anyone and you should never allow humans predict your ability to be happy or sad because if they do, they will always look for ways to make you remain sad.
