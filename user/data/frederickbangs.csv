I never knew there was a platform that rewarded people for creating contents since I am conversant with medium and reddit, but I do not get rewards for writng except that I gain a lot from reading posts from others as well as writing post.

Marketing is a major key to sales in any enterprise, business, and firm, not leaving the fact that marketing also cut across humans (“the way you dress is the way you are addressed” is a marketing word). With all this said, even events need marketing since it involves consuming a service.
