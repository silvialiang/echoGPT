Champions are found in every facet of life from different tribe, culture, and race. Whether they came from wealthy or humble family background, such men are victorious over circumstances of life. They pulled down strongholds ,subdued kingdoms, stopped the mouth of lions, wrought righteousness and obtained the promises. They were men of good report and valiant for God.

As we all know that the tortoise is a very cunny animal with different kind of tricks, while the hare is a clever animal with a very good speed and can run faster than any animal.
And the Hare often bragged about how fast he could run. The entire animals are tired of this boast and the Tortoise challenged him to a race. All the animals in the forest were happy and gathered to watch.

The Hare ran down the road for a while and then paused to rest. He looked back at the tortoise that was walking slowly and cried out, ""How do you expect to win this race when you are walking along at this slow, slow pace?""
The Hare stretched himself out alongside the road and fell asleep, thinking, ""There is plenty of time to relax.""
The Tortoise walked and walked, never ever stopping until he came to the finish line.

Raise the signpost	


A signpost is a post bearing a sign that gives direction, information or guidance to travelers. It is especially positioned at a point where two or more roads meet to give information and directions about routes and distances so that traveler will have little or no difficulty in their journey.

As a parent, you must raise the signpost that will model your children’s character in holiness, righteousness and godliness. I mean you must bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Today’s children are faced with the challenges of coping with an ever broadening spectrum of influences on decision making and behavior.

Many of these influences have potential negative effects on their growth and development. For instance, social environment has been associated with participation in unhealthy practices such as alcoholism, smoking, drug addiction, indiscriminate sex, fraud etc.

BE WATCHFUL

There are different biblical concepts of sleep. We have the natural sleep, the one that allows the body to rest from fatigue and weariness of the day’s work. Spiritual sleep is another type of sleep which put one in a pathetic condition.

Apostle Paul admonished the church in 1 Thessalonians 5: 5-7 saying “Let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunketh are drunken in the night and the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night.

This simply means that everyone who wants to be with the Lord at the end must remain awake and watchful. As a believer in Christ, you do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this world and spiritual wickedness in high places.

Knowing the caliber of forces and systems you are up against, you cannot afford to doze off spiritually.

LOOK UNTO HIM

Since the fall of man in the Garden of Eden, the universal experience of man is that life is not always a bed of roses. Sometimes the weather is fair, at other times, the wind rises and the storm rages. People are daily confronted with different shades of negative circumstances which come in form of job loss, sickness, bereavement, one delay or other satanic attacks.

Most times, the response of many is to focus on their problem or seek help where there is none until they are completely submerged in the problem. However, the Christian attitude and comportment during such times should be different from the way of the world. How you respond to such unpalatable circumstances will determine whether you will emerge victorious or otherwise.

When the storms of life blow your way and threaten your peace, you should not give in to discouragement, despondency or despair.

Am lost in your love

Your hand in mine
Together we go on a journey
With our eyes locked 
Saying it all without
Altering a word

The fragrance of your tresses
Still dwells in my breath
It stirs my soul
When i hold you in my arms
How can I forget? 
What your eyes spoke

How can I forget the 
Night that we have spent together
I saw you a thousand times 
Then why the restlessness
My heart goes crazy seeing you

There is surely something about you
Every breath I draw
Seeks your permission
I fail to find myself
All that is left is you

Intolerant to a moment
Of separation from you
This is something else
We are close despite being far
This bond is something else
I have seen you thousand times

Yet my eagerness persist
Uncontrollable is the heart
Such is the way of love
My heart goes crazy seeing you
Am lost in your love
And I fail to find myself

I will be yours

Whichever part I take
Your fragrance follows me
You are the dream 
I see every night
Our meeting is destined

Your presence breathes 
New life into me
I’m the barren sky, you are
The moonlight that illuminates it
It is the grace of god 
That your love is mine

The will to die for you
Taught me to live

Giving up all else

My eyes speaks your name
Everything for me 
Comes after you
It’s a million dollar truth and 
I will never leave you.

Do you know that any moment from now, the rapture can take place in a twinkling of an eye. This is the earnest expectation of every believer in Christ. Life on this earth becomes increasingly unbearable; violence, disasters and numerous weird issues daily assaulting our sense of decency and general well-being.

Happenings around us indicate that the rapture may soon take place, but the question is, are you ready to take-off? In preparing  for the rapture, you must guard against the tendency to become presumptuous in your thinking.

Many people feel that if they stick to some set of rules; then they will surely make it to heaven. Unfortunately, it does not work that way! Making rapture is not just based on personal grit or following a code of conduct because “all our righteousness are as filthy rags.

We can never be good enough as candidate of heaven, only God’s righteousness can make us eligible.

Perhaps, the above topic should be considered as the greatest sermon that was preached by the master Himself. The consideration is premised on the fact that Jesus Christ was teaching about priority or goal setting.

In one of His earthly ministrations where He fed the hungry multitude after the whole day teaching, he discovered that they came again the other time. To be honest, they must have probably come because of the miraculous food provided for them by Christ,

They were not there to actually listen to the sermon He wanted to teach them but because of the bread and fish. Nowadays, a lot of people are running after God because of what they want from him. If they get it today, they stop following Him tomorrow.

What a big mistake resulting from misplaced priorities?

The duty of man 


According to Myles Munroe “when purpose is not known, the abuse is inevitable”. The plain truth is that many people do not have the faintest idea of why they are here on earth. They neither know where they came from nor where they are going. 

Worse still is that they hardly care to find out. All they are after is the pleasure of the moment and satisfaction of the present. A lot of them are found with the motto “life is for the living; so let us drink and be merry, for tomorrow we will die.

Solomon, the richest and wisest king in the Bible times treaded the path of self gratification. There was nothing he wanted that he could not afford to get; he was daily feasting and merrying. Eventually, he discovered almost too late that all is vanity upon vanity and emptiness.

After he found the purpose of existence, he rose up from his debauchery and declared “Let us hear the conclusion on the w","{""tags"":[""steemchurch"",""dutyofamanrestingod"",""wafrica"",""christianlife"",""christianity""],""image"":[""http://img.picturequotes.com/2/422/421352/the-first-duty-of-a-man-is-to-think-for-himself-quote-1.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmYfKYGX2M8Qc8nNUi6TqUzHKoeLmafZ6PVBMjt7wjXe5R/upvote.gif""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-08-19 16:50:54,The Duty Of A Man,/steemchurch/@samsonike/the-duty-of-a-man,1

Restitution

Restitution can be defined as the evidence of genuine repentance and spiritual maturity. Most of the sins we commit are not just against God but are also against our neighbors. When you repent of your sins, God forgives you but requires that you make amends with any person you have wronged.

Restitution makes you to repair or give an equivalent for loss, damage or injury you caused. It means to restore money, property or rights misappropriated; properties stolen or took away by force or any other means and pay back debts or unpaid bills. It also makes you uncover your crimes, confess lies, reconcile quarrels, apologize for slander, unjust criticism, cheating, false testimony and betrayal of trust, as well as seek forgiveness from those you have hurt.

Restitution is a cardinal doctrine of the Bible and an aged long practice that predated the law to the time of the patriarchs.

Every happiness is borrowed
Even my sorrows
Are one on one free
I was here yesterday 
And am here today again

And I will meet you tomorrow
Like right here where we stand
At my happy hour
All my worries will drown
In the first go

My heart jumps with joy
The glass is empty pouf
My heart is stubborn
It doesn’t listen to me
No boundaries to its stubbornness

There is no one like me
There is one and only me
There is a lightening in my veins
Like a current that passes through wire
Only at my happy hour

All my worries will drown in the first go
Bring out the naughtiness
Knock on the locks and doors
You are a bird but must break free
With the fury of your wings

My heart jumps with joy
After my worries are gone
I will enjoy my life to its fullest
Like right here and right now
At my happy hour

You can be free

Do you know you can be totally free, you can come out of that satanic prison and captivity? You can be free in your soul, spirit and body. You will be free everytime and everywhere and you will sing songs of freedom. The lord of host has promised to do it for you, but you have a role to play.

What God does for you when freedom is near is that He begins to show you your true state how you are bound and tied up in sin; He opens your eyes to your desperate need of deliverance from the bondage and affliction of the enemy.

Yet God doesn’t just stop at revealing your faults to you. He wants you to play your role by making a deliberate turn from iniquity. You have to make a decision to turn from sin to the Lord Jesus Christ. You have to flee from the kingdom of bondage to the kingdom of liberty.

While doing this, you will not bother yourself with what people will say about you or your decision.

Me:”That’s a pleasant name, Omolara you are in which class?”I asked jokingly while she blushed. The closing bell finally brought an end to our discussion; it has been a sweet first day at school.

REST IN GOD

The natural man is constantly in search of fulfillment and satisfaction. Like a sea tossed by wave, his heart perpetually in a restless state; seeking for peace and love and happiness. This constant longing of his heart drives him to labour everyday in other to fill this void. Some labour for more money and education while some strive for power, thinking that the attainment of these would still the restlessness of their hearts.

The reality is that the more man possesses, the more his heart longs for something greater. No level of human accomplishment or attainment can fill the emptiness in him. Nothing in this world can satisfy his inner cravings! This is why the preachers, in Ecclesiastes conclude that without God, all of man’s labour on the earth is vanity upon vanity. It is simply laboring for the wind.

LOVE AND UNITY

Love and unity are very important components of any enduring and lasting relationships. Due to human depravity, imperfection and misunderstanding of peoples intention, we tend to offend one another. It is practically difficult for anyone not to err but relating with people in love will make you overlook their faults.

Love and unity are intertwined! Love is the bedrock and cornerstone of every thriving relationship; hence, it underlines unity. For instance, you cannot forgive someone without loving him/her. Likewise, you cannot be united with people without loving them.

To maintain a cordial relationship with God, you must learn to forgive and forget all offences from the depth of your heart. Ensure you settle every disagreement and dispute, show love to your offenders so that the bond of unity can be kept.

God wants believers to daily demonstrate agape love to people ","{""tags"":[""loveandunity"",""wafrica"",""christianity"",""christianlife"",""steemchurch""],""image"":[""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYv9h2BkeAcN9DVQBAenmRQa6jE2iwLJcJSVSHyyaP46u/Unity-in-Love-1.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmYfKYGX2M8Qc8nNUi6TqUzHKoeLmafZ6PVBMjt7wjXe5R/upvote.gif""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-07-02 11:33:18,LOVE AND UNITY,/loveandunity/@samsonike/love-and-unity,1

Arise Go

‘’Arise; go to Nineveh, that great city and cry against it; for the wickedness is come up before me’’. This was God’s charge to Prophet Jonah. From the Old Testament dispensation till now, God has been charging His saints to arise, go and preach the gospel to all people and all nations.

The Lord Jesus Christ before His ascension, re-echoed   the charge to his disciples and by the extensions of Christians, ‘’Go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature’’.  This explains why the early Christians went preaching the good tidings everywhere. God’s charge is arise, go!

Mind you, this is neither a charge to wait for people to come to you before you witness to them nor a command to try and get them into the church to hear the gospel preached. It is a charge to arise from your comfort zone as a Christian, go to where sinners are and preach the gospel of repentance to them.

I sat down quietly on the chair which was meant to be for two students, I tried my best not to look back at the others, I had always be known to be one kind of a shy guy. My sitting style was like that of a girl who was just visiting her fiancée’s parent for the first time, I sat closing my legs, my elbow rested on my laps and my palms supported my chin. Anyone seeing me at that moment would think I was suffering from severe cold.

I placed my bag very close to me like someone was going to steal it if I dare let it go. I was lost in thought, I missed my previous school and was wondering how my friends will be like now not seeing me in class, I never told any of them I won’t be resuming with them not even my best friend Michael. They will all receive the shock when they don’t see me in school again for good two weeks. I had no intentions of telling them.

Examine yourself

When God calls a man to salvation, he calls him into an intimate relationship that thrives on faithfulness, submission and continued devotion. Being infinitely holy Himself, He expects anyone who seeks to have an enduring relationship with Him to desist from all works of darkness and continually walk in the light.

He wants you to honour Him daily and sincerely seek to please Him; to believe, accept and abide by the precepts of His word; to make righteousness a way of life; and most importantly, to remain in the hope of heaven by earnestly longing for the second coming of Christ .

In the summary, it is to live a victorious Christian life over sin, Satan and the world. Living this victorious life requires constant examination of thoughts, words, actions motives, interactions etc. in the mirror of God’s words admonishes that one should examine himself to know whether or not he is in the faith.

A GLORIOUS ESCAPE

From the immemorial, God has always made a way of escape for the righteous before releasing His judgment on sinners. Several accounts in the scriptures corroborate this statement. In the day of Noah, before destroying the inhabitants of the earth with water, God instructed Noah to build an ark for the escape of the obedient people.

Before the exodus, He also instructed the children of Israel to kill a lamb and sprinkle its blood on their door post so that they could escape the plague of death as an angel smote all the firstborns of the Egyptians in one night. Before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah with fire and brimstone, he sent angels to bring out lot and his family for safety.

These are just few among many cases mentioned in the bible.

Problem people face in a relationship

Relationship can be defined as the way in which two or more people or things are connected, or the state of being connected
Don’t get it twisted love is a beautiful thing, one seems to be biased at time when not in love, but what happens next when a person fall in love. His or time is now been shared with his or her partner and most times some partner do not seems to understand each other, and by doing so the relationship may not last long.

Don’t get this wrong, it’s very good to fall in love especially when one fall in love with the person who understand and love the person wholeheartedly. To love is to care, to care is to feel, to feel is to cherish and to cherish is to have the mind to embrace any problems or shortcomings of the other person. To love is also good but generation of nowadays don’t tends to fall in love.

Someone once said “When a person works an eight-hour daily and receives a fair day’s pay for his time that is a wage. When a person competes with an opponent and receives a trophy for his performance that is a prize. When a person receives appropriate recognition for his long service or meritorious achievement that is an award. But when a person is not capable of earning a wage, can win no prize, and deserves no award; yet receives a gift; that is a good picture about the grace of God.”

By implication, grace is earning what you do not deserve at all. It is God’s free gift of salvation for all, and the gateway into heaven at the instance of repentance from sin through faith in the atoning blood of Jesus Christ. The scripture says “….all have sinned and come short of the glory of God”.

Numerous ancient African civilizations settled in the region that is today Nigeria, such as the Kingdom of Nri, the Benin Empire, and the Oyo Empire. Islam reached Nigeria through the Borno Empire between (1068 AD) and Hausa States around (1385 AD) during the 11th century, while Christianity came to Nigeria in the 15th century through Augustinian and Capuchin monks from Portugal.

 The Songhai Empire also occupied part of the region. Lagos was invaded by British forces in 1851 and formally annexed in 1861. Nigeria became a British protectorate in 1901. Colonization lasted until 1960, when an independence movement succeeded in gaining Nigeria its independence.

Nigeria first became a republic in 1963, but succumbed to military","{""tags"":[""steemit"",""democracy"",""wafrica"",""steemrepo"",""africaunchained""],""image"":[""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcZHw36cBe9CnvoNE6HRbt9Vu3WqgDTUzPkthAJGMTJdi/QmWwd1xp8FHCGwUqAFi4kP6R41QXmvhFJD7iABst64RTaL.png"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmYfKYGX2M8Qc8nNUi6TqUzHKoeLmafZ6PVBMjt7wjXe5R/upvote.gif""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-05-29 11:06:09,Democracy,/steemit/@samsonike/democracy,0

Whenever our mind, body and spirit speaks it is important that we listen. A lot of times we will hear God tell us to let go of things that are only weighing us down, and we must be willing to exercise the free will we have to make the correct decision no matter how far we think it may set us back in the moment. 

Learning when to trust your intuition comes harder for some than others, but it is a principle of wisdom that we all need to learn to apply in our lives as it is very helpful in almost all situations. Sometimes trusting your intuition over everything else can help to save you from experiencing painful circumstances, and save you from trouble that can easily swallow you whole. Many times we know what is best for our own lives, we just have to be confident enough in our intuition to make the right decision.

A lot has been said about the need to be careful when talking to or about someone. However, there are times when it is best to just keep quiet and say nothing at all. Silence is a great virtue, but sadly it is disregarded by many. It is the ability or rather the grace to be still, calm, quiet or at peace within and without oneself.

This is not a manifestation of weakness as some people think but a rare display of wisdom and maturity. Apostle James said the true measure of someone’s level of maturity and spirituality is not his ability to use his tongue but his ability to withhold it.

Generally, it is advisable to maintain silence when there is nothing positive or constructive to say. This will save you from making vain, suggestive and slanderous remarks as well as their attendant consequences. More importantly, cautious silence is crucial when you are provoked because words uttered in anger can wrec","{""tags"":[""silenceisgolden"",""story"",""wafrica"",""steemschool"",""steemchurch""],""image"":[""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZ32xHxVbkiHKyhoWwh1WA2kLiKha4Rt9neRrqsfwZp5c/preview.png"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmYfKYGX2M8Qc8nNUi6TqUzHKoeLmafZ6PVBMjt7wjXe5R/upvote.gif""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-05-28 14:21:57,Silence is Golden,/silenceisgolden/@samsonike/silence-is-golden,1

We both are a lovely pair
And the talk of the town
I shall land on your waist 
And buy you a waist band
Your dress has mesmerized me

Your smile makes my heart skips
You have captured me 
And must share your secret
And also pledge you love
To me and become mine

The night is over 
The morning has arrived
Happiness has crossed all limit
My heart leaps and jump 
With the beat of the drum

I feel like only being by your side
All the rest of my life
Because you have won my trust
My feelings and my heart
You are one in a million 

Don’t you know that I have 
Forsaken the world for you
Because you are my other half
And I will always be there for you
Because you are mine.

We both are a lovely pair 
And no one can come
In between us
I feel save anytime am with you
Because you always make me happy

No greater love makes the world go round like the one that made Lord Jesus Christ leave the grandeur of heaven to sacrifice His life for your sin and that of the whole world. In His infinite love for you, he she His blood on the cross of calvary to pay the ransom for your soul. He made a huge sacrifice to save you from eternal punishment.

The sinless Jesus died in your stead to cleanse you from sin and reconcile you to God. Have you ever wondered why God did not send an angel to die for you and the entire world? Perhaps, such sacrifice was too much for them to bear for humans. But Jesus, propelled by deep love for our sin. Beginning from His betrayal to His crucifixion,He suffered much for your sake.

Although in this century i also believe in love because one fall in love at times with someone who is much more older than us, and this has happened to a friend of mine too who fell in love with his sisters friend, and at the end of the day the lady gave in to him and things turn around for him.

Many believers do not know that there is more to accepting Jesus as their Lord and savior. As a result of this ignorance, they are unable to live victoriously over sin and temptation. They rise today and fall tomorrow; there is no consistency in their walk with the lord.

Despite the provision of God for them to live above sin, they still find themselves always confessing their iniquities and struggling to overcome the sinful world. Really, attempting living the Christian life without inward purity is like trying to fight a ruthless, heavily armed enemy with broom stick.

Infact, the danger there is better imagined than experienced. One writer says “The remains of the carnal mind will hinder the development of the spiritual nature”. The energy and time required in working for Christ is used in keeping the old nature subdued, even when it had been slain and buried over 2","{""tags"":[""purity"",""christianlife"",""wafrica"",""steemchurch"",""christianity""],""image"":[""https://steemitimages.com/DQmPPfedoCpEJSExHYcD2rbctyCZGNDiTWMCvm8TqrS9noP/christian-purity.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmYfKYGX2M8Qc8nNUi6TqUzHKoeLmafZ6PVBMjt7wjXe5R/upvote.gif""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-05-14 09:04:06,INWARD PURITY,/purity/@samsonike/inward-purity,2

Avoid depreciation

Depreciation can be defined as the decrease or reduction in value of something or somebody. For instance, a car that has been used for seven years would certainly not have the same value as the new one. In fact, a car is assessed to have a depreciation of 25% per annum in government establishment: thereby having zero value after 4 years.

In life, everything is expected to depreciate at some point in time, except the Christian life. The moment you become a Christian, God expects you to continue growing in His grace as you are abiding in His word. In actual fact, God frowns at depreciation.

Depreciation in the life of a Christian is synonymous to backsliding which is not usually sudden, but a gradual process. Backsliding may begin with a general feeling of spiritual indifference.

It really takes two to tangle because if two people don’t fall in love, understand one another seriously and also have trust in each other. To like is to love, to love is to feel, to feel is to care, to care is trust and to trust is to give each other their heart.

Before two people can fall in love, the first thing that happened between them will be friendship and from there they can start to discover feelings for each other, starting from either guy or the girl depending on who seems to get more attracted to the other person.

And most people do fall in love with the one’s who doesn’t love them or care about them and such people do take advantage of such opportunity to ride the one who is in love with them by just treating the guy or the lady anyhow just because they don’t have feelings for them.

Your lies have plundered me
It was lying inside my chest
In the season of love
A single gesture

And I gave my heart to you
I gave my love to you
Magnificent…. Simply magnificent 
You are just so addictive
Sweetheart you are just too good

Your attitude is simply amazing
You are so stubborn
Sweetheart you are just too good
Every time I look at you
I never thought twice

A single gesture
And I gave my heart to you
I am going to love you so much
I will love you 100 times in a moment
And don’t ever leave me

If you ever leave me
I will only wait for death
I have forsaken the world for you
My breath stops on you
I love you so much

You can never imagine that 
I have forsaken the world for you
A single gesture 
And I fell in love with you
I also gave you my heart.

No hiding place 

Have you heard of the scientist who goes by the name Charles Q, Choi he is a scientist who developed a camera that can see invisible stains without tampering with them.

This was made a discovery made by chemists at the University of South Carolina funded by the National Institute of Justice. This same device has the capacity not just to capture one but hundreds of images in just a few seconds while illuminating scenes with pulses of infrared rays. It allows light from the molecules investigators are looking for to stand out from their surroundings.

The device could be used to detect bloodstains, drugs, explosives, and fingerprint. This is just one among many other sensitive detective devices humans developed in this highly technological age to ensure they unravel as much secrets as possible.

Please be my lover

These are the beautiful evenings
My life gets brighter when I saw you
Lets get pixilated as the night come along
It will be great.

The day has passed 
It’s all about the night
You are talking insensibly
It can make my demented heart fall for you

Let me go says the girl
I don’t want you on my way
Anywhere you go 
You will find me in your ways
Please stay back for the night with me
It I’ll be great and I’ll be happy

Oh girl, you look like a daughter of berretta

Bioinorganic Chemistry

Bioinorganic chemistry is the study of the structure and biological functions of inorganic biological substances such as metals carbohydrates proteins and lipids forms about 90% of the solid matter in the body of humans.

Bioinorganic chemistry can be defined as a processs that examines the role of metals in biology. Bioinorganic chemistry includes the study of both natural phenomena such as the behavior of metalloproteins as well as artificially introduced metals, including those that are non-essential, in medicine and toxicology.

 Many biological processes such as respiration depend upon molecules that fall within the realm of inorganic chemistry. The discipline also includes the study of inorganic models or mimics that imitate the behaviour of metalloproteins.

Elements of the body are divided into five major groups:

Economic concept of land

Land means different things to different people, depending on their outlook and interest at a particular time. Whereas Henry George, sees land as the habitation of man, storehouse upon which he must draw for his needs, the material to which his labour must be applied for the supply of all his desires. On the land, we are born, from it we live, to it we also return. Take away from man all that belongs to land and he is but a disembodied spirit.

The above is a general view of land and in this respect also, land can be regarded as the as the solid partition of the earth’s surface. Also, land can be said to mean a nation, people or political division of the earth’s surface.

To lawyers and economists, land is considered as any portion of the earth’s surface over which ownership right can be exercised.

99% will not do

As it is that most academic institutions in Nigeria grade 70% as excellent or Distinction in examination. However, God require requires nothing less than 100% in our daily relationship with Him! In rendering worship, fellowship and services unto Him, he wants the very best from you.

 Based on human assessment, one would have given King Saul a standing ovation for conquering the Amalekites and destroying all they had. He only spared King Agad and some spoils meant for sacrifice to God; not even for his personal consumption.

In God’s own rating, he was disobedient because God’s express instruction was that he should “utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not”. This act of partial disobedience greatly displeased the Lord because He actually expected total obedience from saul.

Similarly, God demands absolute obedience from you in your walk with Him.","{""tags"":[""story"",""ninetynineisnotenough"",""wafrica"",""steemschol"",""steemchurch""],""image"":[""https://steemitimages.com/DQmdjuTjAEXABF9VTd8eCxfmBr3rqbi7g2KcXxGMVM45orB/99-is-not-enough-1-638.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmYfKYGX2M8Qc8nNUi6TqUzHKoeLmafZ6PVBMjt7wjXe5R/upvote.gif""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-04-21 11:45:21,Ninety nine percent is not enough,/story/@samsonike/ninety-nine-percent-is-not-enough,3

The student industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) is a skills training programme designed to expose and prepare students of Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Technology, Colleges of agriculture and Colleges of Education for the industrial work situation they are likely to meet after graduation. 

The scheme also affords students the opportunity of familiarizing and exposing themselves to the needed experience in handling equipment and machinery that are usually not available in their institutions. Before the establishment of the scheme, there was a growing concern among our industrialists that graduates of our Institutions of higher learning lacked adequate practical background studies preparatory for employments in Industries.

There are basically three types of production.

2.	Secondary production: these comprises of all kind of manufacturing and construction work i.e turning the materials produced in primary production to finished goods.

Life can also deceive and confuse those who do not understand its real nature and meaning as well as its chief purpose.
God created us for his pleasure and wants us to enjoy every bit of it but SIN’s only desire is to destroy this wonderful gift God has given us. Sin is destructive and toying with it amounts to playing roulette with one’s destiny. The end result of sin is a monumental and colossal loss here on earth and more importantly in the coming eternity.

Sin separates one from God and opens him up to attack from the devil. It makes its victim fall short of God’s glory and bring God’s wrath upon him.

When the wind appears to be blowing contrary, many people don’t see any reason for thanking God. Why? This is because they often want to know the direction God was looking before the wind arose.

MAN AND OTHER FACTORS OF PRODUCTION

Rational human being will not be able to have delight on idleness. Such an individuals will have to engage in one activities or the other if only it’s for a daily means. Sometimes man may engage in such activities to satisfy himself, and also it may also be for the benefit of the dwellers within or outside such environment. In one way or the other, man produces either tangible goods or services rendered.

 According to ANYALE 1987, he described production as the transformation of raw materials into finished goods and distribution and provision of goods and services in the order to satisfy human wants. He believes that since raw materials cannot be eaten in its raw state, it has to be changed to suit human consumption.

  Production is the creation of utility, which utilizes the ability of any commodity services to satisfy human wants.

![scarcity.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYJMxeKvvMxNCZJmwsoxQmL97C41VeYtKFYRwah3GmP4N/scarcity.jpg)


Scarcity can be defined as the limited in supply for all the resources needed to produce our numerous wants. The problem arises over which of these wants, goods or services should be produced to satisfy the insatiable desire of human being. As it is known that the wants of human being are many, these can range from basic need to hyper order needs. The resources within the reach of an individual would determine the quantity and quality of goods and services to be produced as a result, the concerned ind","{""tags"":[""economics"",""wafrica"",""steemschool"",""stach"",""africaunchained""],""users"":[""samsonike""],""image"":[""https://steemitimages.com/DQmS7ce5fEFXPtK46a97ZrK3uK13LTyjUsxUJwtnB5HtAHb/basic%20economic%20problem.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmYJMxeKvvMxNCZJmwsoxQmL97C41VeYtKFYRwah3GmP4N/scarcity.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmZTzHHkiWUr6pJCWxKqi4HUWdoH6abwhmR2pKaC6d7ACm/choice-arrow-target-bulls-eye-word-best-option-24936555.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmbRFat3AvAbgZfyYDcc3ntrVN269Vy6c4c7zN3Gv4uTtM/SCALE%20OF%20PREFERENCE.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmQrNhY1hbxfuijbgts9aF24nTpX5wsJM3tnUitVJFSKSi/OPPORTUNITY%20COST.png"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmYfKYGX2M8Qc8nNUi6TqUzHKoeLmafZ6PVBMjt7wjXe5R/upvote.gif""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-04-13 11:15:27,Mans's Basic Economic Problem,/economics/@samsonike/mans-s-basic-economic-problem,3

No man can be the lord’s champion who has not experienced God’s grace and salvation and deliverance. You must have come out from the land of captivity before you emerge the Lord’s champion. You must have overcome sin and its seeming pleasures. Are you still living the life of bondage in sin? It is unfortunate and saddening that many who were destined to be the Lord’s champions are still finding life in Egypt so fascinating and enticing.

Thus we miss out on God’s plan and dies as slaves, losing the purpose for which they are born. Although Joshua lived as a youth with the bitter reality of slavery, he left Egypt with others. They crossed the red sea and began the journey to the Promised Land. He was singled out of obscurity to becoming Moses’ assistant and subsequently his successor.

What is tax

Tax can be defined as a compulsory deduction from capital or income and income, value of assets which is levied on the citizen of the country to support governmental actions.

Reasons why tax are being levied

The main purpose and objective why government levy tax is to accomplish revenue, development, income redistribution, social justice, capital formation, resource allocation, economic stabilization and planning, stimulation of production and development and achievement of economic objectives.

Of the listed above reasons, the most important of them all with respect to land or property taxation is revenue raising.

George was in the church one Sunday morning listening to several people who gave testimonies of God’s faithfulness. Some people shared with the congregation the miraculous provision and divine intervention experienced after their long period of waiting. He later reflected on the story of Abraham who waited on God for good 25 years. He wondered whether he would have the strength to wait further for what he had been expecting from God.

In the course of the week, some friends advised him on several short cuts to get what he wanted without having to wait on God. He heard of people who succeeded in getting what they wanted after compromising their stand with God. He was called a trusting fool by his friends; this made him queried God ‘why’?

Does Attraction have expiring date

It occurs that whenever a guy meets a girl he likes. He starts talking to her, and there's chemistry in the air. He can tell she likes him from the attraction between them.
He tells her all kinds of things about himself, his eyes wide and filled with excitement. It feels as though there's a bubble around them, in which only they exist; the outside world falls away.
As time goes on, the energy and enthusiasm only builds. It builds and builds, until it hits a peak; a crescendo. And then... it starts to fade.

The guy panics mentally; he can tell he's losing this girl, whom he felt so sure was his only minutes before. He works hard, trying to turn things around, to reignite the passion that was between them. But alas, his efforts fail, and the fire dies.
He's fallen victim to a painful fact of life and love: attraction that has expired already.

My first time was in the middle of the summer before my junior year of high school when I told a girl, “For your birthday, I’ll sleep with you if you promise not to flirt with anyone else while you for summer for a month.” I picked her up at her house in my mom’s car, drove three minutes to an abandoned house in the area, parked in the yard, and told her to take off her clothes and pants. There was no foreplay and, for me, no pleasure.

I went home thinking, I just had sex, but I don’t feel any differently. I didn’t tell anybody about it for over 2 years.

It also took me over a year to have sex again after that first time and I wasn’t bothered by the abstinence. After the second time I had sex, it was another one years before I had sex again.

This Art Museum was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier in 2003, is a must see for those who can really understand the latest tendencies in contemporary art. The huge “nozzles” sticking out from the roof are in fact solar panels which enable the building to generate its own energy and make it environment-friendly

Thanks to the weird architecture and unique computerized lightning system which illuminates the building from beneath the transparent acrylic panels of the roof , the Museum reminds some supernatural creature and is sometimes even called a ‘friendly alien’. Being one of the world’s greatest exhibition venues, this highly functional and technical building meets all the requirements the most demanding modern art owners could only think of.

Indian hemp can be defined as an annual, robust herb with angular stem bearing hand shaped divided leaves with greenish flowers with the botanical name cannabis sativa. The hemp plant are divided into three parts namely, fiber from the stem, narcotics from the leaves and oil from the seed. The leaves serve as drugs to reduce excitement, irritation and pain in other to induce deep sleep.

      The main constituents of indian hemp are called cannabinol, cannabinin and pseusocannabinol. It also contains cannin and resin. The biological activities of cannabis are due to phenolic and alcoholic compounds. These resins also contain a crystalline compound named canin.

Why isn’t life simple
Why isn’t life so simple?
Why do people become philosophical?
When they see the sunrise and sunset
Life is as simple or as complicated
As you make it to be

Life is beautiful and sweet if lived in a good way
Life is God’s breath in us 
It is a gift and a precious one indeed
Life can also deceive and confuse those
Who do not understand its nature?

Life also controls those holds it with levity
Life is but an empty dream! 
For lazy dreamers who sit on their all day and do nothing 
Their philosophy: out of dust they are made, into dust they will go, so why do anything. 

 
LIFE, I believe, is not a dream
So as dark sages say;
Like a little morning rain
Which foretells a pleasant day? 
Sometimes there are clouds of gloom,
But these are transient all;
If the shower will make the roses bloom,

Do you know when this happened
That I am yours and you are mine
I am wonderstruck at this moment
When moonlight shows in daylight
It seems awake, yet it’s dreaming

My lovely heart
Do you know when we got here?
I am yours and you are mine forever
I never knew love is this sweet
I would have fallen in love since

Intoxicated souls….musky bodies
There is presence of pureness in the air
In this our recent moment
There’s so much colour
I am yours and you are mine

Spilling out of our eyes
The blues sky showers on us
Soft with silk rays of light
Do you know how happy I am
That I am yours and you are mine

I am wonderstrucked at this period	
And also blissfully ignorant
Of this love that flows forth
True is this feeling 
And true is our love

Everything else is just an illusion
My heart hums slowly
With the melodious note of love
Do you know how happy I am 
That I am yours and you are mine

 Episode 3



I whispered to her, your sister is at the door! But she kept on throwing back her ass, grinding my dick real fast. Her watery pussy lathered my dick, like soap.

She held her breasts and sucked on of her nipples and was moaning, “please don’t stop fu*king me, your d!*k is too good” abeg na your elder sister invite me come here and na she fit chase me out I say to myself.

Immediately, I used my right hand and covered her mouth and then threw her to the side of the bed, I pleaded with her; “please it is dark, just go under the bed, let me find out what she really wants”.

“Well what else does she want if not your sweet dick, that’s it” Her junior sister said shutting me up. She didn’t even care if we got caught, because she was really enjoying my dick.

An old nursery school rhyme says “tick says the clock, tick, tick; what have you have to do, do it quickly.” The book of God also explains that to everything and every purpose under the heaven, time is allocated. To further confirm the importance of time, the whole creation of God was done orderly within the planned time frame. All these point to the fact that time is very essential and should not be trivialized. A wasted time is a wasted destiny!

It is simply amazing how many people waste the divine resources called time. Regardless of the geographical location, everyone has 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week, 60 in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. Yet, many people still don’t understand the concept of time. That is why the do unprofitable and unimportant things.

I bestow over that love
There was a fearless lion
Which happens to be me?

I bestow over that beloved little doll
My palanquin was adorn
He came for her atop a horse
Where did the love disappear?
I have to tell everyone

I’ll reveal the secret to the people
He was waiting to give away his heart to her
Sifting afar, ages passed yet
This makes him forget the woes of his youth
Just call out to him sincerely once

There was a delicate little doll
With too much love
There was also a fearless lion
Who came wearing a nuptial garb
When his heart broke, it was for love

My love, my love come back now
Even God has forgotten me 
Since the moment you left my side
Don’t know where she vanished
Never found her again

The one like a flower
Withered away
Never blossomed again

I wish she comes back to me

Mangoes are juicy stone fruit from species of tropical trees which belong to the  plant genus Mangifera, cultivated mostly for their edible fruit.

  The majority of these species are found in nature as wild mangoes. The genus belongs to the cashew family Anacardiaceae. Mangoes are native to South Asia, from where the ""common mango"" or ""Indian mango"", Mangifera indica, has been distributed worldwide to become one of the most widely cultivated fruits in the tropics. Other Mangifera species like Mangifera foetida, horse mango are grown on a more localized basis.

   Mangiferin is a pharmacologically active hydroxylated xanthone C-glycoside) is extracted from mango at high concentrations from the young leaves, bark, and from old leaves.  Allergenic urushiols are present in the fruit peel and can trigger contact dermatitis in sensitized individuals.

She is the apple of my eye 
She is my mysterious girl
She’s wonderful
She is the beauty bloom of june
She looks into the eyes and talk

She will make you dance to her tune
She is a big pretty girl
Her style is unmatchable
She is intimidating
She soars in the sky amongst the cloud

She dances to different tunes
Both local and foreign tunes
She is carefree 
She is a heep of sweetnes
Also an ocean of cream

She looks into the eyes and talk
Whatever she does, she does it best
Her speech is mesmerizing
She punishes anybody that toys with her heart
She dances in the fair

She dropped her hair and dances
She is fragile and yet strong
She is as stubborn as hell
She will make you dance to her tune
She is the apple of my eye

I have fallen in Love


Slowly… slowly I started believing
Slowly…slowly I lost my heart here
Has the moon just fallen?
Fallen just like that
Is the earth flying just like that slowly?

This has happened for the first time
That I have fallen in love
I can see it in my dreams
That you will come and tell me 
That you are living in my life


I thought what it was 
You will never hear it slowly from your eyes 
Why is it that my heart is flying like that?
We will not tell anybody
That I have fallen in love

I have got a moment
And hide this moment from everybody
It’s listening to your story
And in that very moment
You made me your own

I have found my tomorrow 
Sleeping on a bed of tomorrow
Is it the earth flying like this
It has happened for the first time 
That I have fallen in love

As we journey in our christian faith just as the children of Israel did to Canaan, discouragements are inevitable on the way.No  matter how we are highly placed, every Christian is bound to experience discouragement. If you have not come to a point where you ask God ""why me"" you have not started the race yet. God only promised us safe arrival but not smooth sail. 

 In psalm 34:19, David, a man who experienced several heart rending problems stated that ""Many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth them from all"". In james 1:2, we are enjoined to count it as joy when we fall into various trials. Paul and Silas were imprisoned but their faith was not deterred and they were set free by divine intervention when they praised God in chains.

  In gethsemane, the son of God became discouraged because of the looming shameful death.

The story of how i smashed 68 girls in three years.

This is very interesting and lovely. You won’t regret reading it. Trust you all will enjoy it?

This Story is not suitable for anyone younger than the age of 18.
 
This whole thing started when I travelled down to Abuja to write my post-utme. My name Is Kolade Emmanuel.  I am a playboy and a fuckaholic. I am from Imo state.
I had left my house at the wee hours of 6am to catch an early morning bus to Abuja because the University of Abuja was my second choice institution; I was going to write the post-utme.
The bus was almost full. I prayed seriously that the person I would seat next to should be an Angel. I paid my ticket and sat close to the window. Soon after the atmosphere in the bus changed; a strong chewing-gum like perfume walked in, announcing an angel – a chocolate angel. I was happy and uttered this in my mind “Finally, my dream came through”.

God please whatever I have done to you, just don’t let this food pass me by, I prayed.

SPEECH

Production of speech sounds

The air which is expelled from the lungs passes through the larynx. Inside the larynx are the vocal cords. The opening inside the vocal cords is known as glottis. So, when the air gets into the larynx, it is modified by the position or state of the glottis. The vocal cords can come in contact with each other and they can also be separated by the activity of the muscle.
When the vocal cords come in contact with each other, the air from the lungs forces or separates them. This brings about some kind of ‘vibration’ or ‘sound’. Hence, the sound produced are called voiced sounds. But when the vocal cords are drawn apart, the air from the lungs has a free passage through the vocal cords. This then prevents any form of vibration. The sounds produced are called voiceless sounds.

After passing through the larynx, the air goes through what we call the vocal tract which ends at the ","{""tags"":[""speech"",""africaunchained"",""genesis"",""project"",""nigeria""],""image"":[""https://steemitimages.com/DQmYwaW3LvUFeygsMhWG4vSeJTfzRxTV61ZcFex9gF1TDQi/speech.jpg""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-02-06 11:43:33,SPEECH,/speech/@samsonike/speech,0

You are special and perfect unique design

You look like you look for a reason
Our ancestor made no mistake
He knit you together within the womb
You are just what he wanted to make

The parents you have are the ones he chose
No matter how much you feel
They are customly designed with GOD’S plan in mind.

The traumas you face are not easy
And God wept that it hurt you so
But it was allowed to shape your mind
So that into his likeness you would grow

You are who you are for a reason
You have been formed by the master’s rod
You are who you are beloved
Because there is someone who likes you
For whom you are.

I am so happy to be in this new NDJT Contest hosted by @mimy

Here is my own entry

At what age did you have your first kiss?

I had my first kiss at age 14. It happened the day my girlfriend accepted to be mine and I was forced to kiss her because my friends old me kissing is sweet and it was actually dope.

What is the cheapest gift you have ever received?

The cheapest gift i received was on my 14th year birthday which was a pack of condom wrapped in a wristwatch and I was actually thinking it’s a wristwatch but to my greatest surprise a pack of condom.

What is the most expensive gift you have ever received from a partner?

The best gift i got from a partner is a 10 round sex which lasted for four hours and after that a wristwatch.

Guys: Which would you rather go without? A comb or a wristwatch?

My day cannot be completed without my wristwatch.

You love GOD wholeheartedly now,
but the challenges, troubles comes 
It looks as if one never heard about God before.


Your family makes you sad whereas you feel accepted n another
Education is expensive but ignorance is costlier
You want to exploit the world, but opportunities says NO
After graduating from the university, there is no job and parents
Siblings are looking up to you.


You are in a dilemma whether to love that girl or hate her
Because of the circumstances between the two of you
You don't know whether to fall in love or for love
There are times you are really battling with yourself
But there is no hope anywhere.

Life is damaged!  life is a gossip

Life is love! life is hate
Life is a teacher! life is a lawyer
Life is a doctor! life is a professional



Life mends! life breaks 
Life is fragile! life is agile
life is everything, and anything 
you can think of it
you are a product of life

Everyone seems to point accused fingers
Thinking everyone is not guilty of the charge
We all know we are guilty of it
But we all fail to accept it.


It exist in every spheres of our life 
Even the immediate family is not exempted 
Siblings tends to hate themselves
And do anything possible to outsmart one another.



Our country is suffering from its effect 
Government workers depend on it more
 than their salary
Politicians have turned around the order
 of our politics.


Our government is no longer free and fair
Most especially with their election
Oh !  what else can we say
You cant be able to win project without the 
help of corrupted officials.


You have turned the whole peace of the
 country around
We can no longer see honest people
 around again
Everybody is corrupted in one way or 
the other
Oh corruption, what a deadly vice to 
our country.

Her hair is so long and attractive
Her eyeball shines bright like a diamond
Her nose is so perfect and lovely.



She has the perfect types of legs
Her curves is something i long for
Her nails are very beautiful
Her skin glows and radiate like a glass
And i can even see through them



She is so passionate and kind
She is meek and gentle
Her character is what is enviable
She has gone through a lot
But still hold her heads up high.

The one who knows her worth
A virtuous woman indeed
She protects her intergrity

Sometimes I wonder how life seems to be
It shows people different phases at,
a particular time
Life doesn't give the chance to be where,
you are supposed to be
It only opens you to where, 
he can make up your time


How I wish we can decide how our
life will be
Maybe everybody will make use of, 
Their prime


Sometimes it shows people the good
Part and then the bad part
Though people seems we can maneuver
our ways.


Like a two edged spear that is very sharp,
that is the way of life
Sometimes I get to think how it is like that


But I have no answer from anybody
Only a answer keeps popping up within me
That is just because you cant just question
your creator.


Because life is short and when you break 
the rules
You need to forgive and forget quickly
Laugh  when needed and never regret 
anything that makes you smile.","{""tags"":[""life"",""africaunchained"",""poem"",""nigeria"",""genesisproject""],""image"":[""https://steemitimages.com/DQmbjKJHLUsceYq8xFS1u8iCdtBbH6dZvLjPS6EjLJEUvtB/life.png""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2018-01-25 14:16:45,I WONDER HOW LIFE SEEMS TO BE,/life/@samsonike/i-wonder-how-life-seems-to-be,0

                             LAND ECONOMICS


            Land economics can be defined as the study of the relationship between human being and land. Land in the aspect which covers the totality of the environment and it’s fundamental to man’s survival. This is true because this provides us with working space, and also provides us with biological and natural capital in addition to other resources of land. It is also our source of food, clothing and a host of other raw materials.

Torture can be defined as the act of intentionally inflicting punishment on people  in order to compel some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, can also be called a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so which are not typically considered torture.

Torture has been carried out or sanctioned by groups, individual, and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day, and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or longer. Reasons for torture can include, revenge, punishment, deterrence  , political re-education, coercion of the victim or a third party, interrogation to extract information or a confession irrespective of whether it is true or not, but simply the sadistic gratification of those carrying out or observing the torture.

     Water supply can be defined as the provision of water for public and private uses through the water corporation or by private and personal means. 
Water is said to be produced from condensation in form of clouds which drops on the ground as rain, hail and snow. It is then becomes either surface water in form of a river, lake and stream or water underneath that forms as well , borehole and springs .

Some purification of this water however is necessary to remove organic and inorganic matter and to reduce the water hardness.

Conflict can be said to be any form of dispute and confrontation between two or more people with incompatible goals.
Of course it is acknowledged that conflict can arise through this means. 
social conflict is the struggle between two opponents over value and claims to scarce status power and resources.

Conflict is also a state of incompatibility among values , where the achievement of the value can only be seen at the expense of some other values, conflict may also arise among single organisation pursuing multiple goals as well as between getting an incompatibles goal . 

            Causes of Conflict

WHAT IS LOVE?

Love is a strong affection, feelings, attraction, admiration, tenderness and common interest you have towards one another or another person.
Love is also the object of attraction that gets u attracted to someone of gets another person attracted to you. It’s also a strong attraction that makes you want to be around your loved ones all the time.
 It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animal.
We use the word love to describe a lot of things, We love food. We love a good joke and we love having a good time. Using love to describe such simple things makes the word seem a little safer. It is safe because we are not exposed. A great cup of tea cannot reject us. A song from our favorite band does not leave us feeling useless. But when we choose to share our life with another person, we inevitably make a choice to become vulnerable.

Men who batter their wives are not licensed to beat their wive but the way some wives behaves also irritate their men to the extent that they had to batter or beat them. This has been disturbing the society at large. 

Things that makes men batter their wives are 
1. cheating
2. anger issue
3. jealousy

       Cheating
When a man catches his wife cheating on him, this may drive the man crazy and dis can lead to batterness in such a way that the wife will regret doing so.
For example a wife who brings home a guy to her matrimonial home and in one way or the other, the husband caught them, such husband can beat his wife in such a way that she will be admitted in the hospital.

Sadly too, homosexuality and lesbianism have become the other of the day , Gay right is now a major political issue while same sex marriage has been legalized in some countries of the world.

It is so funny that its carrier or possessor may at times not be aware of its subtle presence. For a better understanding of the topic under discourse, there is a need to define the key word. Pride is when a man sees himself as a superior human being or when a man arrogates undue power and respect to himself through his actions and behavior. The first sin committed against God in heaven by Lucifer, the archangel, was pride. Pride is manifested in interpersonal relationships and easily causes friction in friendship.

The scripture establishes God’s stand on being proud as He resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. I wonder if any mortal man would be able to move against God’s resistance.

It's possible for any man to ask for sex in a relationship, but is left for you as a lady to know that sex, can't keep him..( Sex isn't enough)
There are two major factors ladies complain about sex in a relationship:
√ After giving him my body he left me..
√ He left because I refused to have sex with him..![514BwJXT6lL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRQPfEBWuqimSusfkkcRFjZHY55BL3NTT9RoajuNHeEzp/514BwJXT6lL._SY344_BO1%2C204%2C203%2C200_.jpg)
NOTE: Both those who gave and those who refused to give are complaining...
( Whats the difference)
Ladies Listen, Sex isn't enough, its not the only thing you can offer a man.
If You Don't Have Anything To Offer A Man Outside Sex, Please remain Single...
A man can't stay with you because his having sex with you....
Relationship is not buying and selling.
There are much to life than Monkey style, Doggy style, Missionary style, Apple n juice style, step pillows style, etc ...

BORN TO RULE

At creation, the plan of God for man was to dominate, control and be in charge of everything on earth. Although, the devil tried to alter God’s plan by orchestrating the fall of man, but glory be to God for making a way of redemption for man through the Lord Jesus Christ.

No child in this world was born either by accident or by mistake. I mean there would be a divine purpose to fulfill before conception of such a person even took place. God told prophet Jeremiah that “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.”

The account of life history of Joseph, as contained in Gen 37:3-11, reveals that he was born to rule. In fact, he became an object of disdain, ridicule and persecution in the hands of his brothers due to the foreseen divine blueprint.

Exalt him always

As kind David declared in Psalms 66:16-17 “Come and hear… and I will declare what he hath done for my soul. I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue”. In the above passage, David passionately exalted God’s name and testified to others about His marvelous goodness in his life.

Notably, if there is anything was anything that endeared God’s heart to the psalmist, it was his life of devotion and commitment to God In exaltation of His power, glory and honour. You too can cultivate the habit of exalting the name of God at all times, regardless of the prevailing situations or circumstances.

If you can have a deep reflection of your life, you will always find reasons to exalt His holy name. out of frustration, some people erroneously think God has not done anything for them. Let me say that there are so many reasons to exalt and appreciate God.

The increasing rate of suicide and attempted suicides globally is alarming. All over the world, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death and the 2nd leading cause of youth’s death between the ages of 15 and 29. According to the world health organization’s suicide data, about 800,000 people die due to suicide every year.

That is, one person dies every 40 seconds. People commit suicide for various reasons such as bereavement, frustration, despair, depression, a feeling of worthlessness and hopelessness, etc. it is true that challenges are inevitable in life and they can sometimes overwhelm a person.

However, beneath those experiences are Satan’s manipulation and attempts to draw one away from God so he can destroy his soul. He makes a person see suicide as a shortcut to end his misery but in reality, it is an expressway to eternal damnation.
