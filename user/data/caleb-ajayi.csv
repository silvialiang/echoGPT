While they were at the meeting, a senior girl was preaching and telling them about the end time and said the Lord was about to come as promised. Just then, Larry tapped Dele's knees and when Dele looked at him, Larry nodded towards Anthony.
Pastor Anthony was fast asleep while remaining in a single position. Larry was smiling and it was obvious he was trying to stifle a laugh.

When I returned home this afternoon, I was really hungry and I saw a bean cake that was the left over my brother had at night, so I hurried to eat it even if I know it had a type of unsafe taste.

I eat that one and after some time, I eat rice prepared by my sister with a bottle of cold drink  to go down with it, I don't know if it was the bean cake or the hot rice that is disturbing my stomach now, but I know that something is not right with my stomach.

her arms were so captivating,
and the shade of her skin gave all the meaning I desired.

Imagine that you have been blogging for months and you have not given up because you feel that the little money you are making will become something big one day and it happens that you make some mistakes on your post and someone from nowhere just appears to totally criticize the post.

I tell them but wait if she has a great potential and I do not like the way she looks what happens then or let’s say maybe I love skinny ladies and she happens to be really fat, what happens then because what I see every day is the fat body and not the potentials.


What I get to wake up to see every day is this fat body lying down on my bed and I return home to as well meet this fat body again, so do I have to close my eyes whenever I wake up or whenever I want to make love to her, so that I could remind myself that she has a great potential so just ignore the looks.

A team is a number of people with complementary skills who have a committed purpose that is common to them, this people who are involved in a team have a common purpose, have a definite likely goal and a definite approach to get things done for each other.

A good team however requires a good leader who they will all be accountable to and who will on the other hand be accountable to them.

I say that information has the power to destroy a person because some pieces of information are wrongly passed across and it makes a person become invaluable or non-existing.
A wrong information has the power to utterly destroy what you believe in and ruin you completely.
However, what makes an information destructive is when you refuse to investigate the matter properly before you make any relevant conclusions. 
An information that is not properly researched upon could make you do something in a wrong way.

All over the world, it is very difficult to ascertain if crimes are frowned upon or supported, or maybe the rule is that the rich and influential can commit it while the poor can not.

Well, I cannot speak actively about your country but I can speak about my country. I can tell you about Nigeria because I live here and the truth is that not all criminals are punished.

Rather than concentrating on the problems we have, we should rather concentrate on our strength, on our passion, on our ability to become problem solvers and on our ability to make a difference. It is necessary that we know that our ability and strength is not in the habit of continual blaming of self or regret.

I had been invited some days back to a fellow friends birthday party.

I agreed to go with them just to enjoy myself and when we got there we found out that it was just a little and really rather quite party, there was obviously no crowd because I learned that the celebrant was someone who likes to keep things cool and he doesn't enjoy too loud parties. 

There were other friends who as well came to celebrate their friends special day with him, when we got there we found some ladies dancing and whining their waists continually, it was obvious they were having a nice time.

You will wonder what I mean when I say ""My sister gave birth to my uncle"".

It is not a news any longer when you hear that a man of 70 years gets married to a young lady of 18 years old. Some of them are forcefully given out to the old men so as to close or cement relationships which may be political, business, friendship or to close a contract.

This is absurd and uncalled for but the greed and reward of the act have blinded their eye towards seeing the right thing.
___

This is a story of a girl who was raped continuously by her grandfather who is wealthy. This horrible and devilish act has been perpetuated by the old man for years, since when she was sixteen. The lady has no one to cry to for help since she lives in her grandfather's house. She started living there when her parents travelled out of the country.

When you see other people who are succeeding, you need to celebrate with them and even encourage them to do better. The encouragement of success helps people to want to do better or achieve more greatness.

Success should be encouraged in all works of life instead of the usual discouragement that people get. The feeling of discouragement has the power to destroy one’s pursue of excellence and greatness especially if the discouragement is coming from someone you look up to.

I have this friend whose parents are really wealthy and so many people wanted to get close to her because of the financial benefit they can obtain from her, she could not differentiate between those that loved her or those that just wanted her for the money, but she still moved along with her numerous league of friends who wanted to associate with a rich and influential man’s daughter.

What scared her the most was that she had so many lovers who proposed love to her continually, they all wanted to get close to her for the benefit they could obtain, the guys kept coming after her each day and she got more and more confused, she reached a age that she was supposed ","{""tags"":[""intrest"",""truth"",""africa"",""nigeria""],""image"":[""http://cdn-media-2.lifehack.org/wp-content/files/2017/08/28001309/z2WspnNPT0awSln08i6U_full_Romance-Movies-Out-2016.png""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=imgres&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiH4eDFmKDWAhXLvBoKHTbtBcQQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lifehack.org%2F623689%2Fthis-is-how-you-can-tell-if-a-woman-is-interested-in-you&psig=AFQjCNGgmW9WPNdoiYZ6gVppL3uF-sf5sQ&ust=1505324405062435""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-09-12 17:41:39,Becoming Genuinely Interested in Others.,/intrest/@caleb-ajayi/becoming-genuinely-interested-in-others,0
caleb-ajayi,do-you-deserve-people-s-trust,Do You Deserve People's Trust?,trust,"Trust is a very great and rare expression of belief in someone else. Trust as a unique essential in life should not in any way be underrated. It is sometimes a difficult choice to trust someone because you are scared of the fact that they might let you down, but as difficult as it might seem to trust, it is also an essential fact of life that needs to be practiced. In this world we live in, it could get very discouraging to trust people because all that you get at the end of the day is that people end up hurting you.


I cannot say it is good or bad to trust people because I think it is a matter of self opinion, to trust people means that you believe in their ability to deliver and deliver well. Trust could however be abused by people who are ungrateful and I think this is one reason why people do not trust because they are scared that they might get hurt by the person they have given their trust too.

I wonder, why my towel will get dirty when I take my bath regularly, I always believe that taking your bath means you are washing away dirt from your skin so why will my towel get dirty when I wipe my body with it.
I felt really bad washing the towel because I do not expect what is used to wipe a clean body to become dirty, or may be the skin isn’t clean after all.

Why will I spend minutes to take my bath and at the end still come back to wash my towel I used to wipe my skin.
