When the closing bell rang, john went to his brothers class to pick him as he usually did. As they walked on the side of the road holding hands and going towards their house, which was at the end of the street, john was thinking.

This is when a person is being kicked, pushed, or physically hurt by another. Emotional bullying is when something is being done to make a person lose confidence or feel bad such as isolating a person. Some girls do this but it's not good. And bullying can be verbal. This is when someone is being teased, mimicked, insulted, or called names. If you are being bullied, it's important that you let your teacher know about it immediately.


He paused for a few seconds  to allow his words sink in. He continued. ""Some people don't know how to react to handle bullying. The right thing to do is to report to a trusted adult so it can be stopped. If you tell your teacher, your teacher will let me know and you can be sure that we will take appropriate actions to stop it.""

 But it is also amazing that many businesses are selling their products and services at loss because they never estimated the  total cost of transporting the goods and services to the market where the trading will occur in first place. Have you ever heard this old saying, we lose money on item being sold, but the only way to make the profit back is on the volume. But to be sincere it is not possible. 


You need a policy of good quality control system, which make sure that all product or service you are going to sell is of good quality and standard,  that your customers are satisfied with and happily to purchase from you again and again to the extent of inviting  their fellows to patronise you.

 So why would you not allow me to take decision on my own and find the best way out to solve my problem. All you keep saying is for me to wait for the right time and this question had been bothering me when would my time come? Or may be when am going from this life entirely.


 I think I have to accelerate on a high for me to reach that podium am heading to. To many people this may sound to them as desperation. But to me, this elevated point am wishing to reach is like heaven that you have to do everything he takes within your capacity to get to reach that there.



 So don't can't this act as desperation. My quote often is that whatever be mine will always be mine forever.

Literally the believe is that the Gold smith that hit his hammer on a particular steel knows what he was looking for. So it natural for every man that invest much of time in something worth while must be financially independence or successful. 



Going through history of self made millionaires, i mean people like Walmart who have made million of dollars because of their orientation about business, time and risk involved.


 But categorically, i am saying when you work 10hr in a day compare to the person working in 18hr, the productivity of the two working hours will be total different. Because the time invest in the business is different, then the output should not be same. So I quite understand time is now money.","{""links"":[],""image"":[""https://img.esteem.ws/dtvkrr7cqq.jpg""],""tags"":[""investment"",""time"",""nigeria"",""work"",""africa""],""app"":""esteem/1.5.1"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""community"":""esteem""}",2018-04-20 14:20:42,Work throughout day and night,/investment/@ghen/work-throughout-day-and-night-6a2e944fc24c5,2
