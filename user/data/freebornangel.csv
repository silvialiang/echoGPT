<p>If you are not following this site then you probably aren't ready to be free.</p>
<p>You got to ask yourself why things trigger you.</p>
<p>Why does hearing 'cops are satan' or 'Keep Working, Stop Paying' cause you to react sooo strongly?</p>
<p>Those most cherished beliefs you hold are what keeps us from the next level of global cooperation.</p>

<p>You know, in that self help kinda way?</p>
<p>Well, the thing that separates us from the gorillas and bears&nbsp;is that we can pass knowledge across our generations.</p>
<p>If it weren't for books, and maybe thumbs, we wouldn't have risen above subsistence so quickly.</p>
<p>We would still be having to pass knowledge through oral histories, and when you start talking about jsons, apis, metallurgy, chemistry, botany,&nbsp;etc, I think you can see how that would quickly&nbsp;break down.</p>
<p>You would have to be in the same room long enough to assimilate the knowledge with somebody&nbsp;that can lay it out to you in terms that you can understand.</p>
<p>Could you imagine trying to build Steemit if everybody had to be in the loop to hear it audibly?</p>

<p><code>The 3 day commemoration leads to a march at the streets of almost every city in Greece, but mainly in central Athens, where a usually a massive march is organized towards the American embassy, that is being accused of co-operating and imposing the junta regime at the time.</code></p>

<p>If you are not aware, Kurt thought that this world was a Disneyland for Dummies.</p>
<p>At one time, he was in favor of lining up those on the left and executing them in a wholesale slaughter.</p>
<p>But, when I met him he claimed to be an anarchist, a peasant anarchist, to quote him.</p>
<p>So, there must have been a real departure from what he grew up advocating.</p>
<p>I can't say for sure, I missed my chances to get an in depth interview before he died.</p>

<p>As much as I hate being a curmudgeon some days, on other days it comes in handy.</p>
<p>If steem is created to create the reward pool.</p>
<p>If this steem is then divided 90% to Steempower holders and 10% to everybody else, ie, witnesses, sbd interest, reward pool, etc.</p>
<p>Then it is impossible to buy and hold steem without daily losses in value.</p>
<p>This loss can be mitigated, or even reversed by a rising steem price.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This loss can be recouped by draining the reward pool.</p>
<p>This loss can be recouped, and even&nbsp;exceeded, by becoming a successful author.</p>
<p>But not by everybody.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My math needs to be crowd sourced not just because I haven't done much algebra&nbsp;lately, but also to garner respect as&nbsp;to it's accuracy.</p>

<p>Bitcoin won't save the world because rich people will ensure that all the rules favor the rich at the expense of the poor.</p>
<p>Steem is unlikely to save the world because that is the way the central developers are taking the platform.</p>

<p>I was reading @krnel's post: https://steemit.com/hardfork/@krnel/change-hardfork-17-to-get-some-things-passed in which he states that there are 0 witnesses against the sp delegation.</p>
<p>I seem to remember one, at least, that said that perhaps this issue needed to be revisited in light of the purview I had shared with him.</p>
<p>Let me go on the record here.</p>
<p>Sp delegation allows the whales to make an end run around the wall created by the experiment, they can power up their favorites, or sock puppets, and we go back to the way things were before @smooth and @abit took the reins in their own hands.</p>

<p>When a boss walks into the room, everybody shuts up because they don't want to lose the favor of the boss.</p>
<p>You can discern the leaders from the bosses by the folks shutting up because they want to hear what the leader has to say.</p>

<p>This math is still whack.</p>
<p>My current voting power is 55.35% and still my vote gives a penny.</p>
<p>Now I'm pretty sure that 1500sp does not qualify me for that kind of return.</p>
<p>So, my question is can hf17 adoption by some witnesses allow some blocks to go through with hf17 features?</p>
<p>And, if that is the case, what does that mean for the security of the system?</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I do support the new environment provided to us by @abit, and @smooth.</p>
<p>I just think that the downvoting should have been weighted towards those that have feasted a little more than me.</p>

<p>My vote is giving .01usd on a new post.</p>
<p>I only have 1500sp.</p>
<p>Other people with comparable sp are not giving .01usd.</p>
<p>I got a vote from @berniesanders&nbsp; that registered lower than me in the vote list.</p>
<p>I thought those were based on sp.</p>
<p>More sp, higher on the list.</p>
<p>But when I went to see what was up with Bernie he has 17 times more sp than me.</p>
<p>Soooo, if you can tell my why my math is acting like somebody has 'shared' some sp with me, that would be nice.</p>

<p>Now my account value is out of whack, too.</p>
<p>I should be over 300usd, but I am not.</p>

<p>I'll be soooo glad when we can get back to me spinning dreams of what life will be like when we can order anything we want from the interwebz and it will be delivered to our door simply because we are good people.</p>
<p>As most of my followers know I advocate for a keep working, stop paying model of consumerism.</p>
<p>I think that as long as the folks that worked today, work tomorrow, the shelves will be restocked of what we take from them whether we account some profit for the shareholders or chew them off as the ticks that they are.</p>
<p>Instead of slaving in the mines and factories for the least the crapitalusts can conspire to pay us, we short circuit their cushy paradigm by continuing to do the work while refusing to pay them for the fruit of our own labor.</p>

<p>And I have your attention.</p>
<p>I propose that authors get rewarded for holding Steempower.</p>
<p>I think that votes received should be multiplied by a Steempower multiplier.</p>
<p>An author with xSP should get less than an author with 10xSP.</p>
<p>This will incentivize holding SP rather than selling it.</p>
<p>The idea that holding SP gets you more for the votes that you do&nbsp;get should appeal to everybody.</p>

<p>There is more to being an anarchist than seeing a circled A on a skateboard and liking the idea of not being told what to do.</p>
<p>The test of an author's book to determine it's classification as a classic is it's ability to read as if it was written today.</p>
<p>While the latter part of this book is a history of some of the better known names of the times, the early parts of the book describe how life was nearly the same 100 years ago.</p>

<p>WHEELS OF RAGE</p>
<p>Table Of Contents</p>
<p>A Freeware Novel Of Action &amp; Adventure</p>
<p>By Kurt Saxon</p>
<p>Mostly true story of the Iron Cross motorcycle club of the seventies. Nearly all ex-Nazi storm troopers, they outclassed every bike club in southern California. Being borderline psychotics helped. Their exploits got them headlines and jail time. Big Mike Brown, formerly George Lincoln Rockwell's bodyguard, was club president. The book, used as a character reference, helped get Mike four years in Federal prison for an attempted bombing of the U. N. A psychiatrist, after reading ""Wheels"", pronounced it the best study of a sub-culture he had ever read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well I was gonna buy some steem with this visa card, but overnight the price of steem on @changelly has gone from 20% below spot to 42% below spot.</p>
<p>I am good with the price of steem, but I'll be damned if i'll give the money changers 40% for the pleasure of using their gateway.</p>
<p>If you are in the middle plains state and want to sell your steem let me know.</p>
<p>It is a good thing that visa bank card refused the transaction because I would have been really miffed it had gone through.</p>
<p>If I had known that I had to ID myself to use the card&nbsp;I never would have bought it.</p>

<p>We should add a curve to the reward math that takes author SP&nbsp;into consideration?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An author with xSP would get less bonus than an author with 10xSP.</p>
<p>This way if you want to be a high earning author you can invest in the platform and increase your payouts.</p>
<p>I think this may give us another valid reason to hold SP.</p>

<p>IF you got some Steem Backed Dollars now is&nbsp;a good time to take advantage of the no fee internal market.</p>
<p>IF your plan is to power it up for now&nbsp;anyway, then transferring your sbd to steem will help take pressure off the price, and increase the print rate for new sbd.</p>
<p>I made my mistake in getting impatient, I sold sbd at .145 and got caught in the plunge, so I just powered up once I realized that 'they' weren't interested in letting the price rise to the .15 I wanted to reconvert at.</p>
<p>Now it is even lower.</p>
<p>I'm converting what little sbd I have, now.</p>

<p>The cheetahbot does a wonderful service for us here.</p>
<p>It is an invaluable tool for checking content that has been taken from others and passed off as the reposter's own.</p>
<p>This is something that is necessary to keep the community well informed.</p>
<p>Absolutely essential.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My problem arises when the cheetahbot doesn't check it's facts.</p>
<p>When the cheetahbot references the op's&nbsp;own content as questionable this is bad.</p>

<p>If nobody complains then there are no complaints and things don't get better.</p>

http://www.steemimg.com/images/2017/01/21/happiness-is-homemade8c22b.jpg

When we look at who has voted on our posts we see a list from the whales down in order of sp in the account.

I would like to see them listed according to the weight of the vote that was given.

@Fyrstikken gives us all 1%votes but gets placed in the list as if he had voted with 100%

I would rather see his name where he actually fell in relation to the other votes that I got.

If I get a 100% vote from somebody with less sp than he has, and that person's vote brings more rewards, the higher value vote should be listed higher in the list as having given more, imo.

Thanks for all you do for us.
The natives have been restless lately and I don't want you to forget that some of us have great gratitude for what you have made possible for us.
Especially when it seems to you that we just don't agree with anything you like,....

<p>Downvoting is going to persist on Steemit as a thing.</p>
<p>This is just fine, we need an acceptable outlet to express dissent.</p>
<p>Flags are for content that offends nearly all of us.</p>
<p>Downvotes can be allowed to be irrational.</p>
<p>Some trolls just like downvoting, and we need to make a space for them to express their views, too.</p>
<p>At least until they get downvoted off the UI.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So, can we get a downvote button, perhaps hidden in the flag as a choice in a dropdown menu?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>'You have chosen to flag this content, do you want to downvote because you don't like the content or it's rewards,&nbsp; or to&nbsp;bring authoritarian eyes to it because it is likely to harm Steemit?'</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This allows flags for 'illegal' content while allowing downvotes for rewards being too high, and content that makes us emotional.</p>

I'm going to take a minute to explain your monetary system to you, don't be surprised if you want to throw rocks at banksters when I am through.

The Federal Reserve is a privately owned bank that creates money from nothing and loans it into our economy.

http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm

They say that they print $100 at a cost of 14.3 cents.

So, the banksters make $99.857 for each $100 bill circulation.

Then they charge interest on top of that.

They never create money for interest, they only create money for principal.

That means that in order to pay off the interest incurred by your loan you have to force somebody else's loan into default.


Let me put that into a more relatable form.

If GM loans out 1000 cars to 10 people on 10% interest then you would clearly see that it is impossible to give GM back more cars than the factory created.
It is physically impossible t","{""tags"":[""money"",""economics"",""anarchy"",""life"",""skoolsux""],""image"":[""http://www.steemimg.com/images/2017/01/22/keep-working-stop-rzaj6rc5f67.jpg"",""http://www.steemimg.com/images/2017/01/14/no-one-rules-xzjaeb2f899.jpg"",""http://www.steemimg.com/images/2017/02/01/pyramidfba80.jpg""],""links"":[""http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm"",""https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/634553665922801676"",""http://facebook.com/proclaimation""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-02-22 01:55:48,Do you understand the Federal Reserve?,/money/@freebornangel/do-you-understand-the-federal-reserve,8

<p>I use @steemvoter to support the authors on my list and earn a modicum of curation awards.</p>
<p>It compiles the first list of posts that I read each day.</p>
<p>It simplifies my experience here.</p>

<p>Now that I am learning more about Steemit I have put my attention to the internal market.</p>
<p>If I can buy low and sell high, I can multiply the rewards I get.</p>
<p>So, I am watching the feed waiting for my trade to go through.</p>
<p>It's pretty tedious watching a pot for a boil.</p>
<p>Especially when the flame is low.</p>
<p>So, I got to noticing that some bids would disappear and be replaced just that quick with a bid that wasn't in the queue a moment before.</p>
<p>Now, my experience with the internet is somewhat limited, but that reeks of bot trading to me.</p>
<p>Which led me to the question, 'Where do I get one?'.</p>
<p>If you can answer that, kindly put it in a comment?</p>

<p>From the story:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the United States has unleashed a wave of anger across the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faced with the frightening prospect of an authoritarian right wing government, many people have chosen to take their opposition to the streets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the days surrounding Trump’s inauguration, Washington DC became the scene of continuous disruptions and resistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the day after the inauguration, one of the largest international mobilization in recent history took place with an estimated 4.8 million people marching on over 700 cities around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These days of action marked a clear rejection of the Trump administration and the global rise of right-wing populism.</p>

<p>THE DAY MARS INVADED WASHINGTON</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Clarence hated Martians. He had hated them since he'd watched a science fiction story on Martian invaders a few weeks before on the ward's TV. This hatred and then fear was reinforced by a rerun of the old Kevin McCarthy version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". He was the only person in the State Hospital who realized the Martians were getting in just like plant pods, growing bodies occupied by the souls of Martians.</p>
<p>To Clarence, movies were true and on purpose. They were made and shown to alert him to the dangers to those he loved, which was everybody. He retained them and called up incidents from them in flashbacks whenever he was uncertain. His guides saw to that.</p>
<p>So Clarence knew all about the Martians. But his doctor would not believe him.

<p>Kurt Saxon had some funny ideas, often put forth purely for their irony.</p>
<p>I mean, why else would he put out a definitive 'bomb' book when he considered the country&nbsp;a 'Disneyland for Dummies'?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you take the time to read his viewpoint you will find a man that just wanted everybody to survive a little better, mostly.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>I have tested the efficacy of the receipe's claim, it does in fact make laughing gas.</p>
<p>My experience was that I needed to evaporate more water from the brine.</p>
<p>Were I do it again, I would super saturate the brine to reduce steam production when making the gas.</p>
<p>If you have never experienced laughing gas, just go buy some at the welding supply store, but be sure to ask about adulterants, the do-gooders in&nbsp; your state may have beat you on the draw.</p>

<p>The test of an author's writing is if it feels timeless.</p>
<p>Does it read today as if it was written yesterday?</p>
<p>For me, at least.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Many of Kurt's essays could have been written yesterday, but were mostly written between the 60s and 80s.</p>
<p>Kurt isn't with us any more, but he lives on in the hearts, and blogs, of his fans.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I hope exposure to his viewpoint does for you what it did for me.</p>

<p>They could not collect another dime in tax and still pay the bills for two years.</p>

<p>I must not have been clear yesterday.</p>
<p>The proposal was that the @steemit account start voting for folks.</p>
<p>I proposed that we find a way to make that voting equitable.</p>
<p>I'd think that it wouldn't be hard to set the bot to vote only people that it hadn't voted in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>I haven't seen recent stats on how many posts are going up a month, but i'd think a 10% vote from the steemit account would be a nice boost.</p>
<p>Much better than a kick in the pants.</p>

<p>I'm sure that we could reach consensus on everybody wanting the biggest whale of all to come by and vote us once a month.</p>
<p>IF you disagree with having a whale vote your content, despite it being the worst post ever posted out of all the posts ever, then speak up and let us know.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>My proposal is that the steemit account should vote the 40 votes a day that is optimal to maintaining voting power.</p>
<p>I think that there should&nbsp;be a bot put in place that votes the lowest sp first, but works it's way through all active posters so that each account gets one sequential vote.</p>
<p>Once the bot votes you, you shouldn't get another vote until everybody with a post in the last 30 days has had theirs.</p>

<p>That would have been a hard sell for me, when I signed up all I had to give up was a reddit account with positive karma.</p>
<p>I stayed on reddit for about 20 minutes some years ago.</p>
<p>I understood that the crowd was not going to be to my likings so I left.</p>
<p>I had to get somebody to upvote me so I could join Steemit.com, luckily that didn't take long.</p>

<p>If you took the time vote for authors that you like up to their 30 day payout window rather then just voting for the newest and latest, it's possible that you will help yourself, and the authors, more.</p>
<p>Votes that are made in the second payout window go into their own pool that may, or may not, increase the value transferred by you to the author.</p>
<p>I'd think that data&nbsp;on this is lacking.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will decide that voting the older posts of a few authors are better than rewarding flashes in the pan that come through the twitter (new) feed when you run out of folks in your personal feed.</p>
<p>I know I am going to start ignoring the trending in favor of finding older material that deserves the money more, imo.</p>

One of the two cops (Korkoneas) aimed towards the kids and fired two shots.

<p>Lucy Eldine Gonzalez Parsons (c. 1853 – March 7, 1942) was an American labor organizer, radical socialist and anarchist communist. She is remembered as a powerful orator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parsons entered the radical movement following her marriage to newspaper editor Albert Parsons and moved with him from Texas to Chicago, where she contributed to the newspaper he famously edited – The Alarm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following her husband’s 1887 execution in conjunction with the Haymarket Affair, Parsons remained a leading American radical activist as a founder of the Industrial Workers of the World and member of other political organizations.</p>

<p><code>Pipelines leak. It’s what they do. And the Dakota Access pipeline will be no exception.</code></p>
<p><code>The 1,168 mile-long pipeline is intended to transport crude oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, passing through South Dakota and Iowa. From there, it will connect with another pipeline to transfer oil to terminals and refineries along the Gulf of México.</code></p>
<p><code>However, its construction has hit a snag in Standing Rock, North Dakota. Since September the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and allies from around the world have been pushing hard to prevent the pipeline from cutting through Sioux Treaty territory.</code></p>

<p>Somebody said to me that the folks on reddit didn't have a problem learning markdown, so I should, too.</p>
<p>Now we know one of the reasons I was on reddit for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Lucky for me I didn't close the account and had it to get on here,....</p>
<p>Another was the community, I really found no love there.</p>

<p>Here, it has taken a little while to start seeing any money at all, but the folks have always been nice.</p>

<p>Of course you do, the oligarchy needs you to accept him as the definitive authority on communism.</p>
<p>You can bet that if marx's ideas didn't serve their purposes you wouldn't know his name.</p>
<p>As evidence of this I submit Bhagat Singh, any idea who he is?</p>
<p>http://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/11/27/bhagatsinghd5c00.jpg</p>
<p>He's the guy that made ghandi palatable, absent Bhagat's willingness to sacrifice his life for the freedom of us all ghandi would have remained unknown outside his local population.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As further evidence to support this claim I'll introduce you to Mikhail Bakunin.</p>
<p>http://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/11/27/bakunin056d3.jpg</p>

<p>We only get as much freedom as we take from those that would kill us to control us.</p>
<p>How long has it been since you ran a deserted red light at 2am?</p>
<p>Since you drove without a seatbelt?</p>
<p>You can see how much freedom the pot smokers are getting, it only took 100 years, but without all those people that smoked and went to prison for our right to be free we never would have broken the DOC bank.</p>
<p>Those people that sacrificed their lives into the belly of the beast are the true heroes.</p>

<p>Then perhaps you can help me.</p>
<p>I am trying to figure out how to trade anonymously.</p>
<p>So far, I can only find places that want my banking info, and I am not comfortable having a bank account, let alone keeping money in one.</p>
<p>I don't like the idea of a website being my bank, either. Mt. Gox,.....</p>
<p>So, my question is: Can I send btc to a paper wallet?</p>
<p>I'm sure that I can, but I don't know how to do that, what is involved, and the safety of doing so,....</p>
<p>If you can share some enlightenment for me, that would be most excellent.</p>

<p>They provide access to scientology materials and you know how them folks are about copyrights.</p>
<p>I tried to load them through startpage's proxy and it wouldn't come through.</p>
<p>And today the site is down.</p>

<p>The thing that is freaking me out is that my spambox is nearly empty.</p>

<p>This is an excerpt from a pamphlet put out in the defense of Emma Goldman by a contemporary of hers.</p>
<p>If you have not taken the time to read from the <a href=""https://minds.com/freebornangel"">minds</a> that are omitted from your compulsory education take the time now&nbsp;to <a href=""http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/cleyre/indefenseofeg.html"">read the whole speech</a>, you will see why it has been excluded from your skool's reading list.</p>

<p>I mean, it's bad enough that the new folks are getting 50 steem for signing up and I had to start at three, but now that I have my 10x (thanks @steemsports!!), I still can't power down?</p>
<p>I don't really want to exit the platform, and my curation awards are already plenty low, but the fact that I am being blocked when I have met the conditions set at the outset is rubbing me the wrong way.</p>
<p>I get that folks would create accounts just to cash out that 50 steem, but I have clearly demonstrated that I am not one of those, I don't have the coding skills to create the bots needed to make that profitable.</p>
<p>I think instead of requiring 10x the amount started with that perhaps a other metrics could be used, ie, number of posts, number of followers,&nbsp;reputation, use of the platform, whatever, but to put out a hurdle and then the hurdle be false, raised after the fact,&nbsp;that is not conducive to bringing in the masses.</p>

<p>Illegalism is an anarchist philosophy that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland during the early 1900s as an outgrowth of individualist anarchism.</p>
<p>The illegalists openly embraced criminality as a lifestyle.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the concept of ""popular illegalisms"" created by Michel Foucault in Discipline and Punish.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Emergence</strong></p>
<p>Illegalism first rose to prominence among a generation of Europeans inspired by the unrest of the 1890s, during which Ravachol, Émile Henry, Auguste Vaillant, and Caserio committed daring crimes in the name of anarchism, in what is known as propaganda of the deed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Influenced by theorist Max Stirner's egoism, the illegalists in France broke from anarchists like Clément Duval and Marius Jacob who justified theft with a theor","{""tags"":[""anarchylibrary"",""anarchism"",""anarchy"",""skoolsux"",""life""],""image"":[""https://img.youtube.com/vi/iwwosQvWxig/0.jpg""],""links"":[""https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwwosQvWxig"",""http://www.submedia.tv/stimulator/2013/01/18/podcast-2/"",""https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/605215128094257168"",""http://facebook.com/proclaimation""]}",2016-10-17 01:29:51,Insurectionary Anarchism,/anarchylibrary/@freebornangel/insurectionary-anarchism,2

<p>Ok, so I have taken on a tough row to hoe.</p>
<p>I have called out some of the highest profile 'anarchists' on the web for not being anarchists, but instead being in the service of the oligarchs as shills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Albeit, potentially as dupes. Maybe they just haven't done the reading.</p>
<p>It ain't easy escaping the mindset of the paradigms forced onto us as children.</p>
<p>Unless you seek out knowledge intentionally hidden from you, you know only what somebody more knowledgeable than you wants you to know.</p>
<p>You can't know that you don't know something.</p>
<p>Just look at how you define crapitalism and 'communism'.</p>

<p>How ISIS Resembles Yesterday’s Anarchists</p>
<p>Today, revolutionary anarchists seem archaic, almost quaint. But for around 50 years, from the 1880s to the 1930s, anarchists carried out terror attacks all over the world. Buildings blew up; world leaders and random civilians alike were killed.</p>

If you are calling yourself an anarchist, and have not read this book, you are not helping the cause as fully as you could be.
These questions and solutions that you are finding new to yourselves are not, they have been hashed out hundreds of years ago, but it hasn't been in the best interest of those that want to control you to allow these ideas into your mind.
In fact, to do so would sow the seeds of their demise.

It is told of Rothschild that, seeing his fortune threatened by the Revolution of 1848, he hit upon the following stratagem: “I am quite willing to admit,” said he, “that my fortune has been accumulated at the expense of others, but if it were divided to-morrow among the millions of Europe, the share of each would only amount to five shillings.

It seems to me that with gov't infiltration of all opposition groups, that get more than 30 people on the streets at a time, it may be time to take off the masks and stop letting them get away with their crimes.

Just ask Poppy Bush, he said in an interview that 'If the people knew what we had done they would chase us down the street with pitchforks.'

If you did, you would be mad. 
I sure was.

Any local gov't that holds meetings has a Comprehensive Annual Finanacial Report. 
They won't tell you what is in it. 

The turnpike authority in my state tried to put active x controls on my computer rather than allow me access to the public information.

I am a fanatical lover of liberty. 

I consider it the only environment in which human intelligence, dignity, and happiness can thrive and develop.

All activism comes at the risk of everything you value, if it isn't worth the lives of your children, stop now. 

Bow to your slavemasters and teach your children to do the same. 

But, if your children's chance at utopia is worth your life today then pull up a chair and open your mind. 
You may find your answers in this conversation. 

Keep working, stop paying is the short route to a worker's paradise. 

Everybody from the guy that collected the raw materials to the girl that delivered your finished product to your door, or the shelf, did so with absolutely no knowledge of what was happening in accounting. 
You with me? 

If accounting never accounted for anything the workers would not know and could continue working as if everything was perfectly crapitalistic.

I feel bad for you if your need for negativity brings unhappiness to your life.
Not all of us are destined for happiness.
I mean, if you could stumble onto the secret of happiness then maybe you can have some, but you got to make that stuff at home.

Happiness is homemade.

If you take all your choices in how to respond to things, you know, mad, sad, or glad, and you decide to choose mad, what do you want from life?
You are bringing that unhappiness into existence because that is what you have chosen to do.
I bet you can justify it really, really well, it is, after all, how we are taught that others get their way from the earliest days of our existence.
Every knee bows to the authori-tie!!
Seriously, I mean it!!

I tried just being sad that others I've known have decided to chose anger, but man, after a while that is just depressing.

So, how many of you knew the word 'attentat' without looking it up?
Why is the attentat the vote with the most?
If you don't know upvote below.

I was looking up the word for this article and I see the selections have been scrubbed.
Wikipedia used to have a pretty good article, now it's just some band.
http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attentat
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentat

So, for those of you that don't take all your information from the lamestream sources, an attentat is what a voter does when s/he is finally fed up with waiting for voting to work.

<p>As we learned yesterday the minnows around here are rounding errors.</p>
<p>The math doesn't get done past the third decimal.</p>
<p>So, all that time you spent voting was a waste of time.</p>
<p>My steempower has grown from 3 to 10 so it can't be all inflation that is feeding it, but without showing us the math how are we to know what is happening?</p>
<p>The reason that these seemingly insignificant amounts are important is because we are in the first year of launch.</p>
<p>Those tenth decimal place numbers today are nothing, but 50 years from now they will be a nice chunk of change.</p>
<p>Provided we can get enough people to put up with the crap that comes with it.</p>
<p>I haven't seen as much content downvoted lately, so that is something.</p>

By merely co-opting the structures that are the multinational corporations we can usurp control from the money masters by simply continuing to do the work, but neglecting to account for it in dollars.

If you currently make widgets, instead of paying for the materials and adding your value so that you can have a profit, you simply continue to supply your widgets to the demand, except now you don't have to pay for materials and you don't get paid directly by those you supply.
 Instead of paying to go to the opera and supper, you just go for free.
 Those workers are working off their social obligations by providing this work for you to enjoy for free, just as you provided your widgets for free.

Yes, it is a paradigm shift, yes, it will take some amount of time to retrain the populace, yes, in some places shortages could occur, but if you don't like what we have now, there is no shorter ","{""tags"":[""anarchylibrary"",""skoolsux"",""whalebate"",""life""],""links"":[""http://www.trance-formation.com/""]}",2016-09-26 18:55:00,Just another day in The FreeBorn Society!!,/anarchylibrary/@freebornangel/just-another-day-in-the-freeborn-society,1

<p>The frogs were hanging out in the pond.</p>
<p>One day some of them got tired of just jumping and swimming.</p>
<p>They prayed to the great frog, 'Oh, great frog, send us a king.'.</p>
<p>The great frog said, 'But I am your king.'</p>
<p>The regular frogs said, 'Yeah, we know, but we want a king we can see and touch.'</p>
<p>So the great frog sent them a log.</p>
<p>The little frogs were soooo happy.</p>
<p>They could frolic in the water and lay on the log to get some sun.</p>
<p>Life was good.</p>
<p>Then the frogs got bored, again.</p>
<p>They prayed to the great frog, 'Oh great frog this king is boring, send us a king that does more than float around.'</p>
<p>So, the great frog sent them a stork.</p>

<p>Were you forced to go to church?</p>
<p>Ok, but god didn't force you to go to church, did he?</p>
<p>When you got to the church did you sing in the choir?</p>

<p>Did you make a contribution to the offering plate?</p>

<p>I share your concerns, but you got some doublethinc going when you say that&nbsp;people are property and expect them not to be treated like property as currently envisioned by the population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The definitions we use are not always identical.</p>

<p>I'm sure if you are on steemit that you are aware that the skools in 'murica are more about turning out good little taxpaying order following automatons&nbsp;than they are about educating anybody in critical thinking skills so that they can work out their own solutions, but you may not have sources of information that didn't come from the rockafellas and red shields.</p>

Which label you use to communicate your ideas to others is not really important.
What is important is the definitions behind the words.

Truth be known, most of us are communist.

No, not what happened in Russia or China, neither of which was communist, but were state owned crapitalust dictatorships much like America today.

If you come to steemit and you begin to make unusual reward levels that is just wonderful.
You could grow up to be president, or maybe Warren Buffet, whatever.

My problem begins where my perspective differs from your's in that I will not likely ever be a large dolphin let alone a whale.
You have come here and taken the lifeblood of the platform and sacrificed it to your own consumption.
You think that this result is just and fair.
You produced a product and you got your reward.
That's just good crapitalism.
Lucky you, right?

You can see the results of this reasoning in the value of SBD.

If you come here and take money out just as quick as you can suck it up you are crashing the value of the steemit collective, and perhaps the platform with it.

I know it'll be hard for you anarcho-crapitalusts to get over the dreaminess of your new found panacea.
But,
If you come here and crash the platform you haven't done any of us any favors.

That doesn't mean that I am going to share my insights, just that I am getting a handle on the place.

I should've kept up with programing computers, but the only computer I ever wrote code on was a TI-99 4A.
If you can remember those.
I spent all day making this code only to find out that my tv screen wasn't square and that the code I wrote had to be modified and may never have worked.

I got married and went into the army anyway.

So, kinda slow around here.

Have a musical interlude?

<p>We got the bots copy and pasting away.</p>
<p>I see cheetah on them, but I also see upvotes.</p>
<p>If you got a bot that votes everybody without checking out who you are voting it may be a good idea to stop doing that as you are rewarding spammers and plagiarizers.</p>
<p>We are gonna have to step up and make it known to the newbs that spamming and non-original content is not gonna be tolerated.</p>

<p>It is harder to track now, though not impossible, instead of one whale to watch tptb have to search each whale and see where they have delegated their sp, and downvote those folks.</p>
<p>This is hardly politically sustainable, too many minnows crying to down vote them all.</p>

<p>They were discussing the platform before the price crashed.</p>

<p>When I went back I saw that the poster had edited them.</p>
<p>He deleted the original content and put in periods.</p>
<p>No problem, right?</p>
<p>Just change the 'it' in steemit to 'db' and I can see the edit history, right?</p>
<p>Mmmm, no.</p>
<p>Here are the links, you can see for yourself that steemdb is showing no edits on posts that were clearly edited.</p>

<p>The reward curve is super linear to solve abuse issues.</p>
<p>Linear voting has problems with gaming for rewards.</p>

<p>If we made a stairstep plan that mapped out how to up the limit on the 'experiment' that tracks increase in the market cap we can keep super linear voting, while not running off all the newbs.</p>

<p>We only have to do the math that ups voting limits, currently 800mv, as I understand it, with an increase in market value.</p>

<p>At some point, I presume,&nbsp;we grow large enough to support super linear voting.</p>
<p>Maybe we don't.</p>

<p>I was reading a post this morning, that I can't currently find, that was saying that folks in Venezuela were pushing <a href=""https://localbitcoins.com/country/VE"">localbitcoins</a> to record levels.</p>
<p>This led me to wonder who it is that is selling all that bitcoin for Bolivars?</p>
<p>Whoever is selling must have uses for that money.</p>
<p>Who wants to finance Caracas' finest politicians?</p>
<p>Who wants to keep the Bolivar viable?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Maybe it is folks here that are sending money back?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I don't know, but I sure wonder,....</p>

<p>If you have been in business you know that it runs in cycles.</p>
<p>The banksters that pull the strings from the top like to buy at the fire sales that tightening credit rules causes.</p>
<p>If I can cut off your business from the liquidity it needs to stay afloat because you run it on margin, then I can buy your machines for a dime on the dollar at the bankruptcy sale.</p>
<p>If you think that the banksters haven't been working this scheme for centuries, then you just aren't paying attention.</p>

<p>Why is my wallet showing that I only have $33 dollars on the internal exchange, but the internal exchange has the correct $49?</p>
<p>I was a little excited there for a minute, but not as excited as the other day when I had had a tab open while working in other tabs, when I closed all the tabs back to the first one it showed I had a bunch of money missing.</p>
<p>That day I got excited, but only until I remembered to refresh the tab,...</p>
<p>Today I care just enough to post about the discrepancy to ask the question.</p>

<p>It's not that complicated, you just need the right tools, a little know how, and practice.</p>
<p>You could set up a workshop in your garage, if it was fireproof.</p>
<p>Be careful, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.</p>

<p>The American public used to be quite proficient at making things in the garage.</p>
<p>The books available at that time reflected this fact.</p>
<p>With 3d printers coming online, perhaps we can recreate the homemade toys of our great grandfathers?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This book will serve the novice gunsmith as well as the expert.</p>

Morons dont read,...

But, that doesnt invalidate my assertion.
The market economy is gonna end.
Only a couple things need to happen before we can all be replaced by robots and central dining areas.

We know the elites have their plans.
They spell them out for all to see in 8 modern languages and 4 ancient scripts.

If there are 8b of us then only 1 in 16 of us survive.
No need for markets then, we will all be slaves eating in mess halls.

Or, on any given tuesday we can exercise our collective power and simply continue to do the work while refusing to pay for anything.

<p>It really is this simple.</p>
<p>Those that worked up to today made all the goods on sale at the local stores.</p>
<p>When the business cycle dips they can't afford to buy those products back from the crapitalusts.</p>
<p>By simply continuing to work producing the goods the goods will continue to be on the shelves whether the accounting department falls in a lake, fudges the numbers, or get real jobs.</p>
<p>The accounting department is irrelevant to the production of goods.</p>
<p>The cashiers can be replaced by inventory management software that tracks what is taken from the stores in order to re-order the goods.</p>

<p>I don't know about you all, but I sure like seeing my vote give out dimes on posts with lots of prior votes.</p>
<p>I see that the whales have shown restraint with their ominous powers.</p>
<p>Otherwise our little accounts would still have no impact on the interface.</p>
<p>Somehow my vote has gone from not registering to .04usd on a new post.</p>
<p>My sp hasn't grown all that much, but my vote is worth more.</p>
<p>Could that be the new rewards pool calculation?</p>
<p>I think it is just responsible behavior by the whales, and the price being up.</p>
<p>Personally I would like to see this continue as is for awhile.</p>
<p>I haven't seen any real press to sell the next hard fork, and I think that is a good thing.</p>

<p>So, I was sitting around discussing with my self what it is I should do to make some impact on the readers minds for today.</p>
<p>I said to my self, 'Self, memes are a good way to reach into the readers minds and jerk on their stand up and resist chain.'</p>
<p>To which my self answered, 'Oh god not that again, how about something more innocuous?'</p>
<p>So, always wishing to take advice from my self, and to keep my self happy, I thought I would take a look on&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://startpage.com</p>
<p>just to see if anything was available.</p>
<p>I looked last September and the pickings were so sparse I had to learn how to make my own.</p>
<p>So, I selected steem memes as my term and looked in the images tab, and here are some of the ones that tickle my fancy, I hope you enjoy them as well, dear reader.</p>

<p>Alot of folks I have encountered on the internet like to presume themselves as relative experts in whatever field strikes their attention bone.</p>
<p>They feel safe in asserting their beliefs as facts.</p>
<p>That isn't all bad, rarely does a real solution come from 'the' 'established experts'.</p>
<p>If they do find one, they often come early in the careers, before the confirmation biases, and reality of pleasing crapitalust masters, sets in.</p>
<p>So, if you presume yourself to be an expert on what is currently 'wrong with 'murica', and you haven't <a href=""http://archive.org/stream/revoltagainstciv00stod#page/n0/mode/2up"">read this book</a>, perhaps you would like to expand your data set, just a little?</p>

I hesitate to put it under motorsports as lifestyle would be closer to what most non-racing riders do.
This will give a central place to look for folks that like to ride to live.


I'm still in favor of an editor, because I don't want to type out all the strokes needed to make a link when I can copy and paste, but I would be satisfied with a cheat sheet that was a little more concise than the [current one](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/).

The preview is working just fine.
Drag and drop for pics is needed, but I guess that would require additional expense to hold the pics?

There are not too many reasons that will keep me from posting here everyday.

It is almost there for me, thanks @jesta.
I have been trapped on forums ever since fedbook blocked me in '12, and prefer a forum's ability to centralize information better than what we get posting posts to Steemit.

<p><br></p>
<p>So, if we apply the lessons learned from this hardfork to the larger world around us we can see what will happen when the 1% no longer suck it all up.</p>
<p>Imagine what the world would look like if we could reset the reward structure of the whole world.</p>
<p>It really is as easy done as a hardfork.</p>
<p>We just pick a day, say, Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday we all just go to work like nothing was any different.</p>
<p>Except now instead of needing money to pay for things you just got to wait until supply meets demand.</p>
<p>http://www.steemimg.com/images/2017/01/10/keep-working-stop-r8ly2l00ae8.jpg</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some things are gonna be scarce until production ramps up.</p>
<p>Other things will have their demand go to zero, and those folks will need to look for some other way to contribute.</p>
<p>I would think that shortening product miles would be a good efficiency investment.</p>

<p>Kurt Saxon may have been a little premature in his doom and gloom in the 80's, but it looks like his prophecies are coming to be.</p>
<p>Too bad he didn't live to survive them.</p>
<p>He did leave us with the hard work done.</p>
<p>He curated what was available in the diy genre and left us with an amazing amount of reading to do.</p>
<p>When his other books come into the public domain we will have even more to look through.</p>
<p>Today I have brought some of his community defense plans to your attention.</p>
<p>I hope you use the info wisely, there is a war on for your mind,...</p>

<p>I'm sure, dear reader, that some days I just don't bring it.</p>
<p>Perhaps you feel the same.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I propose that we be allowed to resteem our own posts.</p>
<p>Now, without some limits this may get tedious, so I propose restrictions on the free use of the resteem button.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1. &nbsp;No posts newer than 30 days.</p>
<p>2. No posts that have been resteemed in the last 60 days.</p>
<p>3. No more than 3 resteems a week.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Each resteem should be given a marking that indicates that it has been resteemed, and it's past payouts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I would guess that this would have to be changed at the blockchain because each resteem would have to be a 'new' post for payout purposes.</p>

<p>That is 5x's what they promised us for buying into the exchange.</p>
<p>The really great thing about these dividends is that they come in the various coins accepted by the platform.</p>
<p>I am now the proud holder of litecoin, ethereum, and Mexican Pesos that I otherwise wouldn't have.</p>
<p>It's a nice way to get a faucet that doesn't want to lock up your coins for as long as possible.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>In 1921 when this book was written the reading audience didn't have flashylight box cat memes to compete with and had to be much more accurate in their assertions or face denouncement by other researchers.</p>
<p>Today, the only books making it to mainstream acceptance are corporate approved speech.</p>
<p>They will never offer you an option that excludes corporations or political overlords.</p>

<p>Does ganging up to gather more rewards harm the majority or not?</p>
<p>It is readily apparent that absent any guidance 'from above' that the tendency is to reward the popular people far in excess of what is good for the community.</p>
<p>It is no fault of @sweetsssj that nearly everybody wants to be like her, beautiful, rich appearance, successful, and well liked, and so they vote her.</p>
<p>It is truly a tradgedy that someone so sweet gets caught up in something beyond her control, imo.</p>

<p>In this environment where only the popular people can get votes the majority is not going to want to continue to play the game beyond the point that it remains enticing to do so.</p>
<p>At some point the popular people will stop getting votes, or the less popular players will stop playing.</p>

<p>What is going on with steemd?</p>
<p>If I look on steemstats my voting power is 84.65, the same on steemdb, but steemd says I got 100% voting power.</p>
<p>I have my steemvoter paused, and I see no record on steemd or steemdb that outgoing votes have occurred in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>I also noticed that steemstats had me at a 65 rep a week or more before Steemit raised it to 65.</p>
<p>Has there been a fork, or what?</p>

<p>Today in Steemit History:</p>
<p>The reward pool is at 685,513 steem.</p>
<p>There were 16,043 posts.</p>
<p>The simple math says that is 42.73 steem each.</p>
<p>If we allow 25% for curation rewards then each author could expect that s/he had a cut of 32.04 steem each.</p>
<p>However that is not how Steem works.</p>
<p>I don't know if we can ever bring enough stake to bear on the witnesses to get the hardforks to favor everybody rather than just the insiders, but it's a nice dream.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Enjoy your 42 steem, even if they were voted to somebody else for you.</p>

<p>From the story:</p>
<p><code>August 12, 2017 &nbsp;&nbsp;</code></p>
<p><code>Charlottesville, VA&nbsp;</code></p>
<p><code>The ""Unite The Right"" rally took place as scheduled in Emancipation Park on Saturday afternoon.&nbsp;</code></p>
<p><code>As expected, thousand of anti-racist protesters arrived to confront the neo-nazis, KKK members, and other self-identified racists and fascists who had gathered around the statue of Robert E Lee.</code></p>
<p><code>In a repeat of the previous night's events when torch-carrying racists surrounded, trapped, and brutalized student protesters at the University of Virginia, police on Saturday stood back as Unite The Right attendees repeatedly left the boundaries of the park to attack counter-protesters.</code></p>

<p>If you are worried about the crap hitting the fan on the news and want to do something, get out and meat your neighbors.</p>
<p>Now I know that is going to make you look a little weird, but this may be the price you have to pay to avoid riots in your neighborhood.</p>
<p>It's not all that hard, just set your grill up in the front yard and send the kids to invite everybody over for hot dog, hamburger, or something vegan.</p>
<p>Folks that know each other typically talk out their problems.</p>
<p>Even gorillas rarely harm each other in their fights, they toss leaves, thump their chests, but debilitating injuries happen less often.</p>
<p>They know it is detrimental to the survival of the species.</p>
<p>They certainly don't team up into teams that only communicate through violence.</p>
<p>That is reserved for the 'higher' animals, humans.</p>
<p>I mean, who doesn't want to gang up for more rewards, right?</p>

<p>Spam, and minnowboosting vote buying schemes, are why you're not getting closer to the ideal post rewards of ~40usd.</p>
<p>If you divide the pool equally each author would get a total of ~40usd for all their posts, each day.</p>
<p>Anything that takes us farther from this goal is bad for everybody except those getting voted more than 40usd in rewards.</p>
<p>Those 1000usd posts means that many, many people got bupkiss.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, they earned their sp and can vote it how they please, I get it, but to set up vote bots and to spam the network is beyond my pale.</p>
<p>Spaminator is an attempt to get some of those ill-gotten gains back by downvoting them, but the amount is overwhelming them.</p>

<p>I haven't spoken much to @softgrip but I will go out on a limb and say that he just wanted to post posts like this one:</p>
<p>https://steemit.com/life/@softgrip/my-best-mate-jax</p>
<p>But, because of the state of union here on Steemit he got tangled up with @berniesanders and found out that when you mess with the bull, ya gets the horns.</p>
<p>That is too bad, so sad, but this is what we get to put up with until tptb shuffle up the distribution a little bit.</p>
<p>This is no consolation to Jax.</p>

<p>As if the witnesses don't already have enough worries,...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that an option to force an account to power down, in order to cease it's transactions, would be a good thing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If I am not mistaken simply holding steem or sbd doesn't give you authority to transact, one has to have sp.</p>
<p>That being the case, if a consensus of the witnesses says that you are spamming the network they should be able to force a powerdown of the sp in the account.</p>
<p>The steem and sbd's would still be in your wallet, but if you didn't transfer them out before that last powerdown you will have to find a friend to transfer you enough sp to withdraw it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I don't know how that would play out irl, but I do consider final action necessary to insure that spammers and scammers don't continue to ruin our good thing.</p>

<p>When a whale votes, everybody else's vote loses power.</p>
<p>If a whale votes with enough sp to take up 10% of the votes cast on any given day, that 10% comes at the cost of everybody else that voted.</p>
<p>The only way to spread the math out is if the very largest whales don't vote.</p>

<p>If your posts are not getting rewarded, work harder, or longer.</p>

<p>Most of us can see that the current trajectory of politics is to carry us off the edge of civility and into the abyss of all out war.</p>
<p>The powers that shouldn't be are beating the drums and pulling the puppet strings to profit from killing people that just want to be left alone to mine crypto.</p>
<p>If you think that you can wall yourself off and kill marauders from inside your bunker, you may want to take into consideration what the father of modern survivalism had to say about that.</p>

<p>It would be nice if somebody would put out a post, or link to one, that explains the curation reward curves.</p>
<p>I've been here over a year and haven't seen one post that explains how the curation reward curves are affected by time, weight, and the reverse auction.</p>
<p>My question is about these little pilot fish that vote me before the reverse auction ends.</p>
<p>Does their place in line change the rewards down stream?</p>
<p>At what point does the order in which your vote occurred start to impact curation rewards?</p>

<p>That thing is an oxymoron.</p>
<p>Moron is the operant term when dealing with one of these.</p>
<p>They claim to be all gung-ho about anarchism, a real true belieber, but they haven't done the barest reading on the subject.</p>
<p>Perhaps they've only read the latest publications, who knows.</p>
<p>The facts are that anarchism has always been a response in defiance of crapitalism.</p>
<p>That is just a fact.</p>

<p>Today in Steemit history there are:</p>
<p>16,510 posts</p>
<p>by 10750 authors</p>
<p>with 698,466 Steem in the reward pool.</p>
<p>The simple math says that your post could have gotten 42.3 Steem without impacting anybody else's rewards, but that is not how Steemizens like to do it.</p>
<p>We prefer no rewards go to some folks so that others can party like popularity is the only game in town.</p>
<p>The math was written to insure that those with the most stake control who gets 'popularity', and subsequently rewards.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that you will ever rake it in like some of us do.</p>
<p>You have to decide for you how you feel about this disparity in equality.</p>
<p>Vote your witnesses well, they can impact this disparity, if the masses desire it to be so.</p>

<p><code>The result is an important historical document, of interest to anyone who might one day participate in something similar.&nbsp;</code></p>

<p>I am still of the opinion that spam and abuse (mitigation) should be paid out of the inflation and not the rewards meant for authors.</p>
<p>It is hard enough to get rewards here.</p>
<p>To make it even harder by paying wages for things other than creating content defeats the purpose of inflating the steem supply to attract the 'best' content creators.</p>

<p><code>In this month's episode of Trouble, anarchist media collective sub.Media interviews a number of individuals as they explain some of the main principles of counterinsurgency, and identify historical and contemporary examples of how they are put into practice.</code></p>

<p>We will use @statsmonkey's report as he seems pretty reliable.</p>
<p>https://steemit.com/steemit/@statsmonkey/biggest-upvoters-7102017---part-ii/</p>
<p>As we can see from the stats, the top 10 voters, in the last 12 hours, have given 27.21% of the reward pool to the content of 402 authors that they think qualify as 'good' content, or at least authors that they think deserve it.</p>

<p>Complete schematic drawings.</p>
<p>If you need to fend off the marauding hordes it takes autofire to keep up with the human wave attacks.</p>
<p>Other than that, and clearing buildings, full automatic is rarely your best choice.</p>
<p>Any more than 50 yards to your target and the rounds have several feet between them and are unlikely to hit anyone.</p>
<p>Better to aim.</p>

<p>As you may know I use these reports to highlight Steemizens that haven't broken into the mainstream.</p>
<p>It's not easy getting positive attention around here, it probably never will be.</p>
<p>The reward pool is only so large.</p>
<p>The whales only vote for so many people.</p>
<p>Lucky you if you can get rewarded, you must have put in some effort.</p>
<p>Luckily, for you, that effort wasn't rewarded in the same fashion as today's voices.</p>

<p>I propose that we be allowed to resteem our own posts.</p>
<p>Now, without some limits this may get tedious, so I propose restrictions on the free use of the resteem button.</p>
<p><br>
1. No posts newer than 30 days.</p>
<p>2. No posts that have been resteemed in the last 60 days.</p>
<p>3. No more than 3 resteems a week.</p>
<p>4. Each resteem should be given a marking that indicates that it has been resteemed, and it's amount of past payouts.</p>
<p><br>
I would guess that this would have to be changed at the blockchain because each resteem would have to be a 'new' post for payout purposes.</p>

<p>Using the voting bots to improve your visibility does long term damage to Steem.</p>
<p>The money is concentrated into hands that already have enough to make steem worthless and it comes from rewards that could have gone to an author of actual 'good' content.</p>
<p>The distribution of steem is so lopsided that it was easier to take away a reward curve that rewarded later minnow votes with increased value because the whales couldn't control their voting and had swallowed the entire reward pool.</p>
<p>The n2 didn't need to go, those that couldn't keep their hands out of the till needed to go, instead now they trade their votes for sbd.</p>
<p>Yeah, sticn!</p>
<p>The only way to even out the playing field, so that folks will want to play, may be for the whales to undelegated except to @steemcleaners and @spaminator, vote very low powers, and stop trading votes for cash, imo.</p>

<p>I try not to complain too much, I am, after all, the sum of my choices, and I don't have it sooo bad.</p>
<p>Today I am enjoying a day off, given to me by my renter as an incentive to believe that I am free.</p>
<p>I know that were I to actually be free I would only do work that I really enjoy rather than work I don't mind doing in pursuit of later goals.</p>
<p>I just want to retire to a town where it is warm and this job will have put me over the top when it is done, potentially.</p>
<p>Really I do it because I know what it is to not have someone when you really need them and it makes me feel bad to inflict that feeling on others, absent cause.</p>

<p>Well, get your party hats, and signs, ready for the 18th of November.</p>
<p>Most of us don't agree with all of the various reasons that crowds people up in the streets.</p>
<p>For instance, I am not gay, I have no desire to rally for gay pride.</p>
<p>But, if the gay pride people show up at a Bash the Fascist rally, I am all for that.</p>
<p>We need all the help we can get to repudiate fascism, imo.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is some save whale folks, whatever your cause is feel free to join the crowd.</p>
<p>Only through demonstrating our numerical superiority to ourselves can we see hope at the end of the seeking freedom tunnel.</p>
<p>If we divide into groups and have an internecine war it only benefits those that rule us by force.</p>
<p>Which is the problem all of us face.</p>
<p>Comply or die is getting old to me and I am ready to start throwing rocks in the streets.</p>
<p>Are you?</p>

<p>If you have been seeking ways to find freedom from those that rule us by force you may have come across the Freemen on the Land, and other sovereign citizens theories on how to free yourself from the oppression.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, very few, if any, folks have been successful in their attempts to use this reasoning in court.</p>
<p>Marc has a method that does work.</p>
<p>I have personal first hand knowledge of how it works in court.</p>
<p>I didn't win, but I forced them to a draw.</p>
<p>I signed the misdemeanor and walked out with no further consequences.</p>

<p>On any given Tuesday we, those that work for a living, can band together in a joint effort to supply the world with everything that is in demand.</p>
<p>We already do all that work for the lowest wages possible, by simply continuing to do the work, while refusing to buy it back from the wealthy, we short circuit this bankster dystopia.</p>
<p>The wealthy create nothing, why do we sell our labor to them for the lowest wages while buying it back at whatever the market will bear?</p>

<p>The incident commander thought bigotry was perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p>Didn't color his decisions, at all.</p>
<p>Despite the prosecution admitting that the defendents had nothing to do with the property destruction, the testimony in their trial concentrated on the destruction that was not committed by the defendants, admittedly.</p>

<p>This being the case, the only power that cops have over you is the power you give them.</p>
<p>When the cop comes to you with your infractions, asking for your papers because you live in a police state, do you ask him to prove his claim of power over you, or do you wuss out and say, 'yyye-ssssir' and 'can I help you get them cuffs on me', and knock people out of the way to get in the car?</p>

<p>I use SteemVoter to keep up to date on the folks that I follow.</p>
<p>I would use steemit's follow list, but I subscribe everybody that upvotes me, and as you can well imagine that list gets populated pretty quickly, despite my apparent lack of popularity.</p>
<p>So, I was really disappointed by the response I got in their discord that the price will remain 3sbd.</p>
<p>My steemvoter hasn't returned all that much in value to me by way of curation rewards, I follow less popular authors, in many months.</p>
<p>For a time after the hardfork I was doing ok, but since delegation has kicked in my curation rewards average less than 3steem a week.</p>
<p>Thanks for selling out my vote power to line your own pockets, whales.</p>

<p>Emma Goldman emigrated from the Ukraine at the end of the 19th century.</p>
<p>She took jobs where she could get them.</p>
<p>She married a citizen and became one in her own right.</p>
<p>She took up the black flag of anarchism.</p>
<p>She spoke in the streets and in the auditoriums.</p>
<p>She talked her way right out of citizenship.</p>
<p>Her talking made them gov't types declare her dead husband not a citizen, so that they could deport her as not a citizen.</p>
<p>How do you like that?</p>
<p>Here is an article that she wrote about it,...</p>

It's common knowledge among those of us around to see how things were before stinc changed the math.

You've got to ask yourself, if the control freaks control freak on everything else, why wouldn't they send in their operatives to coopt projects that  might interfere with what they got in mind?

Clearly steem was knocked off it's track in order to misalign incentives more in favor of the haves over the interests of the have nots.

This is not in dispute.

So, it is no secret that I think buying rewards, for whatever reason, shows a lack of class.</p>
<p>The same for selfvoting, if you have more than 1500sp.</p>
<p>The same for banding together into a gang that only upvotes it's chosen few.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You buying votes tells me that your content is crap and you wouldn't get rewards otherwise.</p>
<p>So does joining a gang.</p>
<p>That isn't always true, nor is the inverse, but if you are not getting rewards, have you ever considered that you may not fit into the white bread, whitewashed, pleasantocracy?</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>I been here awhile and have never seen a post that explains that the first voter gets X and second voter gets X-1, and how the reverse auction affects all that.</p>
<p>I do know that I have been getting far less votes since one of them hardforks.</p>
<p>I'm guessing that is because if you vote on a post with more than 3 votes on it you get screwed curation wise.</p>
<p>I can't say that for sure, but it sure seems that way in the little fantasy world I have created for myself.</p>

freebornangel,two-more-cents-on-the-sbd-peg,Two more cents on the sbd peg.,steem,"<html>
<p>I was listening to @aggroed and @timcliff talk about the peg.</p>
<p>&lt;iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNpR6Iz5ndg"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>
<p>It occurred to me that on the internal market the peg is holding pretty well.</p>
<p>Sbd has been running about .9sbd to 1 steem.</p>
<p>That is within the window we call a peg.</p>
<p>Now, I'm sure, that nobody is going to claim to be able to maintain the peg on the wider open markets.</p>
<p>Clearly that is not happening.</p>
<p>However, what I propose is that sbd be allowed to float as long as the peg is held on the internal market.</p>

<p>If you haven't paid much attention to what is going on around you, then you probably don't even notice that cameras are on every corner, every stop light, tracking you at every intersection.</p>
<p>You've seen those little white boxes below the solar cells on the highways.</p>
<p>Maybe you have noticed that since their deployment cameras have come down.</p>
<p>Below is what is happening in China.</p>
<p>Do you think that it hasn't already been deployed by the united snakes?</p>

The idea is not new.
[Here](https://peacerequiresanarchy.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/the-monkey-master-fable/) is the idea from 14th century China.
[Here](https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog) is the idea from 1887.
[Here](https://www.abelard.org/e-f-russell.php) is the idea from the '50s.

It's not like the idea is new.
What is new is the 'education' given to you that makes you reject the idea out of hand.
Anything that doesn't conform with what you were taught as a child is suspect, and mostly impossible.
I know, I used to think that, too.
But, I read my way out of the mindtrap that was my fakeducation.

You can do it, too.
I have faith in you, dear reader, after all, here you are reading.
Good Job!!

<p>It's 1.6% of the time.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>A lot of those selfvotes are on comments with one or two votes but less than .02 payouts.</p>
<p>I vote those so that the little guys can have a curation reward, it could be their first.</p>

<p>That is awesome, maybe we will see some folks burning sbd to even things out a bit!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Unless something has changed, the only ways to reduce the amount of sbd in existence is to use the convert feature or promote posts on the promoted page.</p>

<p>Maybe somebody will create a whale that burns sbd rather than enrich the whale even more?</p>

<p>You do know that using them vote sellers only puts you on a treadmill while enriching the already rich even more?</p>

<p>Well, I had intended to make a post about how whale voting cost everybody money.</p>
<p>How by tolerating the vote bots, and ganging up, everybody that doesn't join in the rape loses money.</p>
<p>The simple analogy is if 1000sp is voted in total, and you have 100sp voted to you, then you get 10% of the reward pool, but if a whale, whether individual, bot, or gang then votes another 1000sp for a total of 2k, your 10% becomes 5% and your payout is cut in half.</p>
<p>With 50+ bots, whales, and gangs voting the minnows don't stand a chance in the math, it's just an unpleasant fact.</p>

Ok.

Does the worker care if the corporation gets it's billions? 

Does Jenny Smith look to see if the waltons got their billions this month or does she just stock the shelf?

Does Joe Miner care if the shareholders get their dividends paid out of value that his work created but he didn't get in wages?

NO, we can just make the goods for the shelf and not care if accounting accounts or falls off a cliff.

All we got to do is keep working and stop paying.

Have you ever taken the time to really observe what people do to their children?

Why, if i talked to them that way, well maybe not me, but if somebody they thought they could take in a fight talked to them like that, they'd literally freak out.

I have been actively looking for this ""Collective"" consolidated data for the last 20-years and found it two-days ago.
 
The following two documents are put out by the Data division of the Federal Reserve.

The 1st link is the category listings of wealth held for years 2011 through 2015. 
This covers total Federal Pension Funds; Local Government Pension Funds (L; 119. a, b, and c. L120 a, b, and c); Federal and Local total investment wealth held; same for the private sector (L.118.a, b, and c); financial institutions; insurance Companies, Brokerage; Banks, etc. 
Also included is Worldwide wealth held by all of the above.

With a caveat, of course.
You knew there was a catch, didnya?

Vote sellers have no motive to sell votes without a profit incentive, yes?
No reason to sell without getting paid.
We are playing crapitalism after all, yes?

Currently they get paid whatever they charge, plus 25% of the vote in 'curation'.

Which would be ok in my book, if the reward pool impact of their profit taking didn't diminish everybody else's profit, too.
When the most powerful accounts in the game votes their stake the smallest amongst us are pushed below the dust level.

This story is brought to us by the fine folks at https://intercontinentalcry, your source for news from the indigenous struggle to be free from the oppression of the wealthy, worldwide.

From the story:

* Wixaritari communities of San Sebastián Teponahuaxtlán (Wuaut + a), have detained first and second level government officials from Jalisco State in the town of Mesa del Tirador, in protest of the lack of answers to their demands—in particular, the issue of land restitution in Huajimic, in the neighboring state of Nayarit. The state government officially denies that the officials are being ‘forcibly’ detained.

For instance, many people think the govt is here to help them.
They falsely believe their support of rule by force is making the world a better place.

One only has imagine a world where violence to control others is not tolerated to see the world without conflict.
If violence weren't used to remove people from their homes, all the conflict created by this practice ends.
If violence in the pursuit of one's goals were not tolerated we wouldn't have taxes.
We wouldn't have wars for oil, nor any other reason.

That people think they are peaceful, but support governance by force, clearly illustrates the need for truth and the importance of knowing it.

No longer will the wealthy be able to hire thugs to force their opinions on others.

Histories will exist written by others than just the biggest bullies on the block.

It will also mean an age of abundance.
Instead of wealth going to the 1% it will be much more broadly distributed.
Instead of wage slaving 50 hours a week for 40 years to retire to a trailer park and cat food sandwiches, we will be looking at fewer work hours and cheaper goods allowing more leisure in more comfort.

Taking the time to read my content has once again brought you information you are unlikely to get anywhere else.

I know most of you are not ready to abandon the old paradigm in favor of the new, but the Mayans have spoken.
December 21st, 2012 was the end of the world as we knew it.
On that day, the world was ruled by force.
The farther we move in time from that day, the less control the ruling class has over us.
Their days are at an end.
Rule by bully has had its time.

The youngster wasn’t critically injured, and it seemed like an open-and-shut case of a justifiable use of force.

* In a move that could challenge the proposed path of TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline—and acknowledges the U.S. government’s long history of abusing Native Americans and forcing them off their lands—a Nebraska farm couple has returned a portion of ancestral land to the Ponca Tribe.

* At a deed-signing ceremony earlier this week, farmers Art and Helen Tanderup transferred to the tribe a 1.6-acre plot of land that falls on Ponca “Trail of Tears.”

This question has had me at a loss since it was proposed.

Were the question, what is it to be awake, that would have been simple.
I wouldve just pulled out the infowar and how not being aware that rule by force is a suboptimal management technique means that you are losing the battle for your mind.

But the question is to be aware.

I think being aware encompasses much more than being awake.
One can be awake that the fed is a fraud, or that satanists are ruling the planet, but still not be aware that others are just as much people as you, each with their own right to be free from your oppression.
Not being aware that you thinking you are right because reasons, based on the popularity of the idea, or the consensus of your peers, doesnt make you any more right than the person that disagrees with you.

Just because you think its wrong to video yourself in the bathroom nude while confessing cringeworthy truths about yourself doesnt make it wrong for the person doing it.

To pay even half that is not attractive to anybody that has had time to figure out how steem works.

Coherence to me is when everything is working in unison.
When all the moving parts function together, coherence is the result.

We could all work together to make steem, and the wider world, a more coherent place, but that isnt at the top of everybody's list.

Too many of us put number 1 at the top of the pyramid.
Everybody else comes in second, or later.

This creates incoherence in the biosphere.
We are all in the same boat.
One big blue marble, yo!

As we go through the next week, dear reader, let's see how much coherence we can create.
Instead of pushing our negative judgements onto others, let's bite our tongues.
Instead of doing things 'because we can', let's let others take priority instead.

For those of you that don't listen to much radio in the middle of the night.
[Coast to Coast AM](https://www.coasttocoastam.com) puts out a four hour show 365 days a year.
They mostly cover ufo/paranormal topics with some cryptozoology tossed in to break up the routine.
On a few nights a year, they cover real topics about the deep state and those that rule us by force.
It was on coast to coast that I first heard Alex Jones.

The first hour often has a different guest than the rest of the show.
When George Noory is there he puts out news that isnt getting love from the msm.

If you haven't heard of them, just turn on an AM radio and they can be found anywhere in the country.

[1200 WOAI](https://woai.iheart.com) can be heard in 38 states.

>Last July, as she has for the past 10 years, Dianne Jones spent 45 minutes on a city bus heading to the local WalMart. There, under fluorescent lights, she scanned rows of brightly colored birthday cards to pick out the perfect greeting for her son—let’s call him Tim—who is imprisoned more than 100 miles from his mother’s home just outside New Orleans. The card she settled on was dark brown with trees and a birthday message that read, “For the best son in the world.”

These next few memes came from when the debate was over bidbots being about advertising, or not.
The idea to decline rewards is that if advertising is the bidbots' prime function then declining rewards serves that function, and also stops any impact on the rest of us.
It also sets the price for advertising that reflects its true cost, rather than being subsidized by everybody.
If bidbots declined rewards, their rhetoric would be in line with the facts.
As it is, when the bidbots push something to the trending page, a portion of the rewards comes from all of us.

Many of you wonder why I am so picky about those that choose to term themselves anarchists.
Many of us when we come into contact with the struggle to live free from oppressive rule think that we can just make it up as we go and everything will be just fine.
That may well be, but it hardly qualifies you as knowledgeable on the topic.
There is a long, mostly untold, HIStory to anarchism.
Many lives have been given for you to have your sip of 8usd crappe frapachino, and claim to have been among them.
It's no different than putting on a uniform when you have never been in battle.
The lessons learned through this sacrifice are lost when you do no more than propound your excellent oratatorical skillz.
Get into the streets, or be a voluntaryist.
It's a free world, you decide.

>Why for anarchy and not for anarchism? This may seem like a small point to split hairs over but it is a point which is important to us. It is important because we are interested in a vital anarchist (anti-state communist) milieu. For us anarchism points to the notion that there could be a special set of practices (forms) which can be found out to be complentary for a free life for all. We feel this is foolish and assumes human life could ever take on a singular form. Life should take on the form necessary for its free reproduction, unlike its current state which only serves those who rule/control us.

While maintaining my own groups I've always considered it best to designate a conflict free zone where anything can be discussed without fear of violence.
Open discussion, by those involved, is the direct route to resolving the issue, if it can be resolved.
If members of the group wish to disengage that is their perogative.
If they wish to politic others out, that is also their perogative.
I've seen the backlash against the catty get pretty toxic in it's own right.
We separated the combatants and they agreed to a detente, but it wasn't long before the catty one was frozen out due to her continuous push on the group against the other.

The question becomes, who is more valuable to the group?
The person who becomes toxic when confronted with dissent, or someone that agrees to avoid conflict with the aggressors?

Some years ago, dear reader, you probably wouldn't have liked me very much.
My whole life revolved around how angry I was at the time.
I had been raised by a dad that threatened violence at the drop of a hat.
His only problem solving skill, when it came to me, was to threaten to hit me with a belt, again.
Now don't get me wrong, my dad didn't really abuse me like some I have seen, but the threat was certainly there.
Combine that with boot camp, and suddenly anger looks like a completely normal means to my ends.
Carrot, or stick?

This was a very difficult philosophical hole to climb out of.
How could I have been sooo misled?
I just followed my examples.

I did figure it out one day, after life had left me all alone to think about it.

If you are not familiar with the material I can only speak to my own experience with the technology.
From what I have gathered by reading the books, it is a 'how to' for your mind.

The basics are that we have an analytical mind, and a reactive mind.
Optimal function is to be 100% analytical.
Reactive comes from stress.

We can form a gradient scale to measure our distance from optimal to worst case scenario.
With study we can predict human behavior by their score on the scale.

If you haven't read the material, they recommend starting with Dianetics.
I recommend you start with Science of Survival because what are the odds of you reading two technical manuals in what is left of your life time?

Dianetics is very much a technical manual.
Science of Survival leaves out details while introducing new material, and is more an owner's manual for how the human mind works.

It's easy to declare off with somebody's head, but closer introspection often finds that your immediate impulse is not the optimal choice.

If prison, judges, and punishments were to solve the ailments of society, they would have done it when prison was the holding cell outside the arena.

Clearly what we have is not helping.
To repeat what we are doing over and over for centuries is mass insanity.

Crapitalism creates criminals to give cops something to do.

So, unless something has changed you probably don't have enough resource credits to even vote for this post.
I understand a patch is being made as I make this post, so that may change.
I case it doesn't, know that resource credits resupply on a 5 day schedule.
20% a day.
If you don't use any.

IF you use them all, you will not recharge.
You will not be able to move your money, either.
Hence the patch.

If we could get you rich folks to remember that those pennies you drop on the ground as if they were nothing are picked up by a double digit percentage of the population as having value.

Why sooo many of you refuse to accept that crapitalism will not save us from the ailments that come with rule by force is beyond me.

I mean, it's a simple question.
How, exactly, is the line worker benefited by the shareholders getting bigger dividends?
All the value generated by the company comes from the worker working, not the shareholder holding.

How is the worker benefited by record profits?
Just the whole premise of crapitalism flawed.

It separates us into haves, and have nots.

This weekend, people opened the space back up and were violently repressed by the police who used flash bangs and other projectile weapons in broad daylight.

This question is going to be an easy one, for me, I've been plotting this for decades.

If I could speak to every ear on the planet I would remind them that nobody likes a bully.
Rule by force is *not* a necessary evil.
We can each be masters of our own destinies without men in suits telling us what to do.

That the authoritarians think they can prevail over the rest of us is our own fault for not nipping them in the bud.

What would I do for society?
End rule by force.

But that is just the first thing.

Next I would end wage slavery.

I have proposed a moneyless economic model that requires less work per worker and gives more stuff to the average person than the status quo.
By adopting this suggestion the lives of every human on the planet can be improved.

This goal may be attained by simply continuing to do the required work while refusing to pay for the goods produced by that work.

Keep working, stop paying.

This keeps the shelves full while cutting the heads off of the pyramid.

The basic outlines that formulated this idea can be found in these works:

The treasury creates money from nothing, just like the fed.

This money is loaned from the treasury at 5% to anybody with a good use for it.
If you need money to get a business started the treasury issues a loan.
If you want to buy a house, the treasury issues a loan.

The treasury then spends an amount equal to 5% of the loan into the economy, through infrastructure, social work programs, social security, whatever.
This creates money to repay the interest without forcing some loans into bankruptcy like today.

Today the fed doesn't create the money for interest, the only way to repay a loan is by forcing other loans into default.
This is what the bubbles are about.
The banksters buy at the fire sale and your kids go into the meat market.

To illustrate this concept let's imagine that GM loaned out 1000 cars to 10 people at 10%.
Those ten people have to pay back 1100 cars collectively.

Where do the cars come from if GM doesn't make them?

I have proposed a moneyless economic model that requires less work per worker and gives more stuff to the average person than the status quo.
By adopting this suggestion the lives of every human on the planet can be improved.
Workers already do all the work, it's not like we are asking the to do something extra for the ablility to order literally anything from the internet to be delivered, for free.

This goal may be attained by simply continuing to do the required work while refusing to pay for the goods produced by that work.

Keep working, stop paying.

This keeps the shelves full while cutting the heads off of the pyramid.
No money = No banksters leaching on the back of the worker's work.
No 'profits' for the crapitalusts to continue to enslave those of us doing the actual work.

The basic outlines that formulated this idea can be found in these works:

Think about it, dear reader, on any given Tuesday the workers of the world can short circuit this bankster dystopia by simply continuing to do all the work, but refusing to sell that work to the banksters, and their minions, for wages.

Instead of getting paid in devalued fiat currencies, you get paid in being able to order whatever you want from the internet.

You don't have to use Amazon, but as long as the workers there continue to deliver the goods, I don't see why you wouldn't.
Ebay will likely go away, though.
No money to support the concept.

Instead of giving 90k hours of your life to support crapitalism, you can live in freedom for just ~20k hours.

Instead of paying rent, you just do your social service.
A norm will be established by the math geeks.

Instead of paying an electric bill, it is paid by your continued service.
The electricians keep the lights on because you continue to play your part in machine.

It is so easy to decree 'off wit' 'is 'ead!', but really, dear reader, unless you are willing to do the wet work yourself, you probably shouldn't be so cavalier in your response to things not going the way you would like to see them.

Many of the 'criminals' in prison are there as a result of the system that enslaves them.

A properly managed society would have found them satisfying work when they were ready to support themselves.
Instead of dropping them in the deep end of sink or swim crapitalism, a proper society would have made sure that they were successful because the success of each of us should be our number one priority, imo.

In Mexico, their supreme court says the effects of marijuana are not such that a blanket prohibition is constitutional.
The court said if you can grow your own, grow it!
They haven't fully formed how their control matrix will break down, freedom isn't likely for long, but they determined that Mexicans have the constitutional right to poke smot.

# Britain's Homelessness Shame.

[From the story:](https://unherd.com/2018/11/britains-homelessness-shame/)


>When the American novelist Jack London ventured among the beggars and tramps of the east end of London a hundred years ago, he set out to record the lives of men and women he described as the “refuse of a human sty”.

>City owes $130 billion to public pensions, according to reports
Playstation gamers are now forced to pay an “amusement tax” in Chicago as city officials tax everything to cover underfunded public pensions.

Well, Steemizen, what now?

It's becoming pretty clear that our ceo's idea of a good time is to syphon off as much value as can be had, while gleefully playing his guitar over the ashes.

I don't know that is his plan, but it sure looks likely.

Any of you here before the memory hole swallowed a working platform will recall the prominent voices calling for the reversal of our brilliant ceo's command decisions to line his friend's pockets at the expense of the newbs.
Now we got no newbs, and the price reflects his friend's cashing out.

It is an opportunity for a coup.
The coders will win, or fork to a chain that gives us what we came here for, a working social media site that pays it's users.
Not some bs pie in the sky that clearly is on hold now.

It's clear that we were right, and stinc is not interested in admitting that, nor correcting it.

But, who knows, maybe the rpc nodes would be soooo expensive by now that steem would be unusable.

It would have been a good problem to have.
Maybe @blocktrades would have stepped up even bigger.

Personally, I think we should fork stinc, et al control away, but I don't know how to get us listed on the exchanges.
There are more witnesses outside the top 20 than in it.

Add in that huge Steemit account to use for development and abuse fighting, and most of the negatives stinc, et al, brings to the table are suddenly not holding us back any more.

Once steemd runs on homebrew servers there is no taking us down.

All it takes is somebody to step up and drop the code somewhere we can all see it.

If there is one thing that there is no shortage of in 'murika! it's empty houses.

Now sure, the folks that 'own' those houses want to rent them out, but the rent levels are such that nobody can afford to rent them.

So, homeless people live in the streets due to greed.

## All hail, greed!

Why we agree to play by that rule is beyond me.

[2 trillion dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU4GdHLUHwU) can 'get lost' out of the pentagon, but we can't get folks into houses.
Uh-huh. Sure.

A fork that removes the ninjamined stake has not stolen anything.
A fork that excises the malignant actors that intentionally hijacked the original design steals nothing from them.
A fork that closes your account and moves forward absent your participation has not taken anything from you.

The old fork continues on like nothing has changed.
Your coins are still there.
Your account is safe.

Just as quick as the witnesses are in place the disruption ends.
Each fork moves forward under the new reality.

While we have covered why anarchists oppose Marxism in [section H,](http://www.infoshop.org/an-anarchist-faq-anarchism-and-marxism/secHcon.html) we thought it would be useful to reply to Marxist webpages and books whose content is not explicitly covered in that section.

Your vote can be above, or below, the dust cut off while the price remains the same.

The originator of the term “genocide” attorney and author Raphael Lemkin’s analysis essentially explains this error when his analysis points to how the Holocaust is not a synonym for genocide, but the consequence of Nazi imperialism and Colonialism in Europe. 
While the massive murders by the Nazi government was a horrific case of human destruction the genocide had already begun before the killings.

You can see our first two attempts below, where we approach George Soros and ElonMusk.


In the 100% likely event that these capitalist tycoons don't wanna share their ill-gotten gains with the likes of us, we will be counting on the rest of you to bail us out.

It's not every day that we get exposed to truth.
The flashylight boxes show a perspective of reality, but displays more illusion than reality.
A snapshot of time in an infinity of time.
It is impossible for perspectives to be the whole truth.

You have to decide for you what your truth is going to be.
It may not be the truth of others.
For it to be accepted as truth by others exposing it to other's critique is important.

Today's truth comes from our hero, [Kurt Saxon.](https://archive.org/search.php?query=kurt%20saxon)
His truth may not be everybody's, but it was his.

The fortunate amongst us will learn from his lesson, the improvident will suffer their fates.

http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm 
They say that they print $100 at a cost of 14.3 cents. 
So, they profit $99.857 for each $100 bill circulation. 
Think about that, if you could mark up your wares that much wouldn't you get visions of grandeur, too?
Be willing to kill to keep your market?

Then they charge interest on top of that, because,....FU.

The option to express a no vote on all of the proposals is being denied to the community.

I simply asked that the dpoll include none of the above as an option to select.

We can safely know that most Steemizens are not aware of what is happening with the steem alliance foundation.

Those that bothered to register are a minority of the 50k daily active accounts. (I'm guessing.)
That reflects more on the apathy of our community than it does on the efforts of the steem alliance.

In my opinion, this is little more than a gambit to cement the influence of the ninjaminers.

Creating this, and financing it, through ninjamined stake serves to insure that those folks are not shamed from the platform.

Not all of them, mind you.
Just the one's that abused the n2 enough to force proof of wallet on us.

If they could just take their cash and leave, that would be great, imo.

@dan designed the math to balance the needs of investors with the need to attract users.
The ninjamine blew that balance all to hell.

The price is up, but my vote value seems to be lagging a little.

There are a few different reasons this could be.
My go to reason is that the whales are sucking more up than normal.
I don't know that to be true, but I got plenty of reasons to suspect.
By timing their vacuuming just right they can suck up a lot while most folks, those not on the very end of the long tail, won't notice.

Now, it may just be my suspicious nature, but at this point the benefit of the doubt just isn't falling on the whales.

Ok, dear reader, here we are again where I try to convince you that money is not the necessary evil that you have been indoctrinated to believe that it is.

We are led to believe, from the earliest age, that money is important.
Why, without it nothing works.
We simply *must* follow the rules set by those that control us with 'money'.

Why we all agree to play by these rules is beyond me, but I have probably read things that you don't know exist.
It's like the secret library below the Vatican.
Those that control us know what is in it, and they keep that knowledge from us to control us.
But, give us bread, and circuses, and we care not who sits on the throne.

It's not every day that we get exposed to truth.
The flashylight boxes show a perspective of truth, but displays more illusion than reality.
A snapshot of time in an infinity of snapshots.
It is impossible for perspectives to be the whole truth.

You have to decide for you what your truth is going to be.
It may not be the truth of others.
For it to be accepted generally as truth by others exposing it to the critique of others is vital.

Today's truth comes from our hero, [Kurt Saxon.](https://archive.org/search.php?query=kurt%20saxon)
His truth may not be everybody's, but it was his.
I met him twice at his house in Arkansas.
I don't think he was impressed by me, but he liked the wife just fine.  0.o
I wouldn't hold it against him, I don't like the me of then much, either.

The fortunate amongst us will learn from his lesson.
The provident will grow a garden.

https://www.youtube.com/embed/m1AOZlUflgo

[Lucy Eldine Gonzalez Parsons (c. 1853 – March 7, 1942)](https://www.zinnedproject.org/materials/lucy-gonzales-parsons/) was an American labor organizer, radical socialist and anarchist communist. 
She is remembered as a powerful orator.

Parsons entered the radical movement following her marriage to newspaper editor Albert Parsons and moved with him from Texas to Chicago, where she contributed to the newspaper he famously edited – [The Alarm.](https://www.loc.gov/item/sn94095384/)

Following [her husband’s 1887 execution](https://famous-trials.com/haymarket/1170-parsonsautobiography) in conjunction with the Haymarket Affair, Parsons remained a leading American radical activist as a founder of the Industrial Workers of the World and member of other political organizations.

One of the great things about the criminal cabal that killed kennedy and has ruled the united snakes ever since, is that they have rules about doing things to the faces of the people, and not their backs.

Don't get me wrong, they do it behind our collective backs, but some of us know where to look to find out what is happening.
They use the excuse that all of us could look, but don't, to justify considering us illiterate brutes.

They think that all their pomp and circumstance makes them better people than everybody else.

Emma Goldman was deported from the 'land of free speech' for what she was saying.
She isn't in the HIStory books because of her opinions.

She said things that threatened the rule by force paradigm, and its adherents.
The cops were really, really against that.

Personally I think cops shouldn't have guns, but if you kill one, you should have real problems.
Lowering the level of violence in the society starts with reducing its prevalence in the culture.

The issue is fundamental to the state's position that you are a slave.

Most of us just give them a pass, 'Yeah, I'm a slave. Ya can't fight city hall.'
## BUT,....
If you are willing to learn the method, and hold the criminals that rule us with guns to their burden to prove that we have consented to their rules, you can help us free the world from the rule by force crowd.

Won't that be nice?

I like the idea of putting in whatever minimum of labor is necessary to insure that I don't live as a parasite on those that have worked before me, while not enriching further those that don't work at all.

I don't have a problem working for my living, I just don't like the cut that the crapitalusts think I got coming.

If you weren't aware, Dec. 21st, 2012, was the end of the world as we knew it.
The world as we knew in on that day was ruled by force.

https://archive.org/download/The_End_Of_THEIR_World/ITE_NOV_3_IPOD.mp4

When humans first started out, the family unit was the most important relationship.
Some families were ruled by force, some by wisdom, most by a random variance of the two.

Those families ruled by force figured why not share the bounty?
They were the first gangs that picked up sticks and farmed the neighbors rather than the land.
Through the millennia those families learned that it was easier to rule by deception and <a href=""https://archive.org/details/TheExternalizationOfTheHierarchyBailey"">created the occult</a>.
The occult <a href=""http://fritz-springmeier.dbs2000ad.com/"">perfected techniques to rule by deception</a>, and learned to only use violence to control populations and destroy rivals.

FreeBorn is what you are before your parents tell you that you are catholic, muslim, jewish, Satanist, or democrat.

In order to qualify as FreeBorn you have to go back and re-evaluate all your sacred cows.

I like to assess any rules presented to me as, 'Well everybody knows,...'.

Who made that rule, why was it made, does it only apply in certain situations?

Most of us just accept as a given that the law applies to us.
Well, it doesn't.

You know, in that self help kinda way?

Well, the thing that separates us from the gorillas and bears is that we can pass knowledge across our generations.

If it weren't for books, and maybe thumbs, we wouldn't have risen above subsistence so quickly.

We would still be having to pass knowledge through oral histories, and when you start talking about jsons, apis, metallurgy, chemistry, botany, etc, I think you can see how that would quickly break down.

You would have to be in the same room long enough to assimilate the knowledge with somebody that can lay it out to you in terms that you can understand.

Could you imagine trying to build a social ecosystem if everybody had to be in the loop to hear it audibly?
It would be impossibly complex, a logistical nightmare.

So, that being said I have two books to link you to that were instrumental in my self improvement.

It left folks confused, though.
They couldn't wrap their heads around taking a zero off their totals every 6, or something, years.

I said to my self, 'Self, memes are a good way to reach into the reader's minds and jerk on their stand up and resist chain.'
To which my self answered, 'Oh god not that again, how about something more innocuous?'

So, always wishing to take advice from my self, and to keep my self happy, I thought I would take a look on
https://startpage.com just to see if anything was available.

I looked last September and the pickings were so sparse I had to learn how to make my own.

Citizenship is defined as:
[A person who owes allegiance to a government and is protected by it.](http://www.wordcentral.com/cgi-bin/student?book=Student&amp;va=citizen)

>Riots against President Juan Orlando Hernandez have been raging in Honduras for several days. 
But the media press coverage has been very different from protests against Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro. 
And it’s not hard to see why. 
Unlike Venezuela, Honduras is a close US ally.

>There have been multiple reports of violent clashes between demonstrators and state security forces since the riots broke out last week over Hernandez’s privatization proposal. 
Hernandez eventually dropped the plan, but the riots have since morphed into a more generalized protest against his government’s corruption and unpopular policies.

### One year after the Insurection.

>A year has passed since the uprising that threatened the government of Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua—a largely left uprising against a nominally socialist government. 
Today, as the US government seeks to promote a civil war in Venezuela in order to expand its sphere of political and economic interests, the questions raised by the Nicaraguan insurrection are more pressing than ever. 
What should people do who oppose both Maduro’s authoritarian version of socialism and Guaidó’s authoritarian version of democracy? 
Does “anti-imperialism” just mean supporting governments connected to rival empires like Russia and China? 
What about the Sandinistas, feminists, indigenous peoples, environmentalists, students, and campesino movements who oppose Ortega? 
What about the Venezuelan socialists and anarchists who oppose Maduro?

## The New Wave of Frontal Attacks on Prisons, Jails, and Detention Centers 

>In response to a viral video prisoners released detailing moldy conditions inside of the Dekalb County Jail, fifty people flooded the jail in Atlanta, Georgia, on April 12, 2019, clashing with correctional officers and setting off smoke bombs inside the jail and fireworks outside it. 
The following month, a group twice as large marched to the jail, facing down over 100 police officers.

>Lysander Spooner came from the flintly farmland of rural New England. 
He was born January 19, 1808, on his father's farm near Athol, Massachusetts, the second child and second son in a family of six sons and three daughters. 
Not a single word has survived from Lysander's hand about his father, Asa Spooner (1778-1851); the father evidently was of strong authority. 
In the tradition of rural New England, he was, according to a family genealogist, “a man of great independence and individuality of character.”

You don't have to believe me, you just have to [read some books](https://archive.org/details/hobbessleviathan00hobbuoft/page/n4) from a long time ago.\
If you don't read old books, how would you know that what you have been spoon fed by the 'authorities' in your life was accurate?

Are you tired of freedom and following rules being equated in the minds of the sleeple?
Would you like to wake up a large metro area to your cause?
If you feel the need, you can set up a traffic nightmare guaranteed to make the nightly news, and likely skate away from it.
A little opsec , and viola!
Millions of dollars tied up in inefficiency.

Their cases which have yet to come to trial reveal a continuing pattern of coordinated governmental political surveillance, targeting, and persecution against Refuse Fascism.

[Josiah Warren](https://mises.org/library/josiah-warren-first-american-anarchist) is somebody that you will not learn about in your gov't forced indoctrination.
They refuse to allow ideas into your head that might decrease their control over the very thoughts of your mind.

I know to think this a few years ago would get you a one way trip to the rubber room in the jacket with the too long arms, but facts are facts.
You are intentionally denied information that could free you from the clutches of those that profit from your ignorance.

I've found my way out this trap by reading books written more than 100 years ago.
Back then the control grid was still pipe dream to those that now control it.

You are the victim of a concerted effort to insure that no pesky ideas about freedom, or even that freedom is a thing other than what you already have, have been intentionally denied to you.

Until we end our dependence on the old way of doing things and embrace the new, we simply get a continuation of the past.

Sorry, fellow palnetters, new forms of money may help, but it won't end the problem.
We have to find ways of doing things because they are the right thing to do, and not just the most profitable.

I met Kurt during a stressful period in my life.
Things were in a full state of flux.
Finding his address in a library reference book led to me shaking his hand in his living room.
He wasn't too impressed with me, but he liked the girl with me.

I was saddened to go back too many years later to discover that he had met an uncelebrated end.
I have decided to pick up his flag and advance it as far as I can into the 21st century.
The truths he spoke in the 70's and 80's resonate today just as loud as they did then.
If only more were listening.

Thanks for taking time to read his works.

>Food systems are integral to the support of cities and indeed are vital to living things including people. 
Modern food production in the form of industrial agriculture is incredibly destructive and inefficient. 
There is a great waste of resources in the form of fuel, time, and other inputs with relation to the rural based corporate farming model. 
However, those are not the only problems with monocultural food production.

### It is important, if you want to have a foreshadowing of what is playing out in the headlines today.

### There is a reason that you know of [1984,](http://www.mondopolitico.com/library/1984/1984.htm) but your 'greatest education ever' is a lie they tell you to keep the skool gravy train providing grist for the crapitalust mills.

That thing is an oxymoron.
Moron is the operant term when dealing with one of these.
They claim to be all gung-ho about anarchism, a real true belieber, but they haven't done the barest reading on the subject.
Perhaps they've only read the latest publications, who knows?
The facts are that anarchism has always been a response in defiance of crapitalism.
That is just a fact.

If you think that you can wall yourself off and kill marauders from inside your bunker, you may want to take into consideration what the father of modern survivalism had to say about that.

By controlling what is allowed to exist in your mind they have enslaved you in such a way that you don't even recongnize the bars as controlling you, but protecting you from the dangers of being free.

Now, far be it from me to claim that freedom is totally safe, but it beats being a slave most days, imo.

If you are paying attention, dear reader, you can see that those dang political extremists are hard at work trying to be the new boss, same as the old boss.

We are not being offered the option of being free, only the option of which slave master controls us.

If you can't tell the difference between what we have and freedom, it is unlikely that you are even reading this.
But, listen up, if you find this by chance on a search engine, what you have here is an incredible survival resource.

Kurt coined the term, [Survivalism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Saxon)
Maybe he stole the idea from [L. Ron Hubbard](https://stss.nl/) as Ron said survival is the number one drive in life long before Kurt started making books.
Seemed likely to me.

Either way, Kurt amassed a store of knowledge of home crafts that is hard to beat.

In fact, if we don't do something along those lines we will never escape the crapitalust paradigm.
It is impossible.

As long as labor is traded for money, and money traded for goods, crapitalism is taking place whether we do that on the left and call it socialism, or on the right and don't call it fascism.
Money is the root cause of this issue.

It's great if you have it, but if you don't, life just keeps getting harder.

Clean toilets are a given.
People take care of those things for folks that have money.

If you don't have money, none of that applies to you.

If you are sitting there thinking that violence has nothing to do with you, dear reader, then you should certainly watch this 9 minute video.

Ask yourself, 'IF you refused to pay taxes, or required your representative to represent you, would this violence be occurring?', if your answer is no, then some of this violence belongs to you.

As long as your utopia needs armed thugs to persist, then it sucks.

Why French Farmers are plotting revolution.

>Combray is a fictitious French village in the novels of Marcel Proust. 
It is also a genuine village, or constellation of hamlets and farms, in the Norman hills 30 kilometres south of Caen.

>Daniel Courval’s farm is as satisfying a picture of times past as any conjured by the words of Proust — a stone house and a necklace of out-buildings in a hidden valley on the edge of the ‘real’ Combray. Snowy-white Charolais cattle graze on sloping fields, climbing to a rocky, wooded plateau.

>“Yes, it’s beautiful here but look — look at these fields with all their slopes and dips,” M. Courval said. 
“Most of this ground is full of boulders and pebbles. 
I can raise beef animals here but I can’t do much else. 
That’s the problem. 
You’re looking at the problem right there. 
They, the people in Paris, in Brussels, say that they want the countryside to survive. 
They say we are the custodians of this beauty ","{""app"":""steempeak/1.14.10"",""format"":""markdown"",""tags"":[""unherd"",""palnet"",""neoxian"",""farms""],""links"":[""https://unherd.com/author/john-lichfield/"",""https://unherd.com/2019/07/why-rural-france-hates-globalisation/"",""https://everything-voluntary.com/blog/nsp""],""image"":[""https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/freebornangel/Qyxc0rXR-image.png"",""http://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/11/29/60469306229523662364491.jpg""]}",2019-08-01 14:00:39,Why French Farmers are Plotting Revolution.,/unherd/@freebornangel/6tejie-why-french-farmers-are-plotting-revolution,1

The books available at that time reflected this fact.
With 3d printers coming online, perhaps we can recreate the homemade toys of our great grandfathers?

It's not every day that your information sources point out history that doesn't serve the 1%.

In fact, unless you are ready to free your mind by seeking ideas not fed to you by those that would control you, you are effectively a slave to the ideas they let you have.
Everything you think, everything you believe, your [most cherished sacred cows](https://archive.org/details/BriceTaylorThanksForTheMemoriesWITHPICTURESLARGEFONT_201903) have been established by someone with [your continued slaving away](https://trance-formation.com/) in mind.

<p>Clarence hated Martians. He had hated them since he'd watched a science fiction story on Martian invaders a few weeks before on the ward's TV.

<p>To Clarence, movies were true and on purpose. They were made and shown to alert him to the dangers to those he loved, which was everybody. He retained them and called up incidents from them in flashbacks whenever he was uncertain. His guides saw to that.</p>

The workers do all the work.
When the workers do the work, the shelves are full.
The majority of workers do not go in and ask if the crapitalusts got their billions, or fell in a lake.
They just do their work, go home, and try to escape the fact that they have been enslaved by a system that keeps them serving masters that think, by virtue of their privilege, they are better than them.

That think that the working class is there to be tolerated, at best.

Let me tell you right up front that your lawyer's first loyalty is to the bar association that lets him/her practice.
The Bar Association doesn't care about you, you don't pay dues.

This is one of the things that you probably never consider in your evaluation of your how the system is serving you.

Likely you just go through your day and never consider if the 'just us' system is serving your needs valiantly, or corruptly.

You don't come into contact with them, what do you care?
Lock 'em up, throw away the key, right?

Look around, is that system lowering crime, or do we have more crime than ever?

You know what stops crime, an armed citizenry stops crimes.
Vigilante neighbors stop crime.

And people that learn to proceed without lawyers in court stop crime.

You do not need a lawyer, you need legal knowledge.

>August 7, 2019

>Brooklyn, New York City – 2019 marked the USA’s first anti-fascist extreme metal festival, Black Flags Over Brooklyn. 
Punks and metalheads of all ages traveled to Brooklyn in January to attend the two-day music-fest and mini anarchist bookfair.

>At the festival we interviewed anti-racist organizer Daryle Lamont Jenkins about how keeping a music scene open to everyone means protecting the space from people advocating violence against marginalized groups.

We could have put in our order for a Maserati today, but you didn't tell your friends the secret to getting one.

# Keep working, stop paying.

Freedom is just this one simple step from happening.

Workers already do all the work.
Bosses keep all the profits.
We get 'wages' that cannot add up to the value of the labor that we do.
If the workers could buy back 100% of the value of their labor, there would be no profits.
Profits are unpaid wages.

If all the workers simply stop paying for things, they can escape this bankster dystopia in one day.

No wars.
No iron fisted revolutions.
No blood in the streets.
No new boss, same as the old boss.

Just a simple switch over, on a Tuesday.

I have to go to traffic court to get my license back.

4 years ago I got pulled over for speeding.
83 in a 60.
The damn carbs on that bike weren't synched right and that was all she would give me.
If I could've hit 110, I never would have gotten the ticket.

As it was, the cop didn't bother to put a copy of the ticket in my property, so when I got out of jail, there was no ticket as far as I knew.

Fast forward 3 years, I go to get a new physical license because the cop failed to put that in my property either, and I find out that my license has been suspended all along.
I didn't show up to the hearing because I didn't know there was a hearing.

Well, on Friday I have to go to the new hearing.

Every youngster needs to know how to defend themselves in a fight.
These fighting techniques may be a little advanced for some of them.

These are killing moves, and done right, can give even little kids the advantage in a fist fight.
Use caution giving this powerful knowledge to youngsters, they may use it on folks that don't have it coming.

Our dear friends @submedia have put out another sedition of Trouble.

If you are from the right side of the tracks, support law and order, and pay your taxes, it is unlikely that your confirmation biases will let you watch this.

### However, if your are from the right side of the tracts and empathize with real people, this is just for you!

[Sub.media](https://sub.media) has been providing hard hitting video for more than a decade.
They are big in Montreal.

They also have contacts across the world.

Please take few minutes, 36, to watch their slant on what is happening around you, and in your name, if you pay tax, or hold allegiance to the united snakes.




This is why we can't have nice things,....
I blame the dev's.

freebornangel,where-are-the-curation-rewards-going,Where are the curation rewards going?,steem,"Is it just me, or are curation rewards down a lot?

One of the great things about steem is it shows us the world as it is.
If you pull a string here, something over there moves, too.

When the maximizer whales were taking nearly all the rewards under the n2, there was no doubt about it.
When a whale votes, everybody else gets less.
Steem is a commons.

In [this link](https://steemworld.org/@freebornsociety) you can see that my 30 day curation rewards are ~6x my 7 day rewards.
You can also see that 4x my 7 day rewards won't come close to hitting that 30 day number.

It looks, to me, that the maximizers have struck, again.

[carlgnash](https://steempeak.com/abusive/@carlgnash/re-freebornangel-pyxyfv) tried to say that I had some beneficiary rewards that was doing it, but that doesn't explain what I see.
The curation rewards themselves are down, not just the total.

If you can explain this dramatic reduction in rewards, please do so.

Up to this point we have covered the discovery and Brady request and Motion to Dismiss for failure to present a cause, nor victim.

If these two haven't won already, and you won't find out most likely until your trial date, in a traffic ticket, or preliminary hearing in a real court(never waive those, and fire any lawyer that tells you to) then you need to be prepared to present these two to the court.

Remember to bring copies for the DA, clerk, judge, and yourself.
Everything you present to the court needs to be in those hands, it is your responsibility as your own lawyer to get that done.
Be sure to do it, or you will lose, on a technicality, but a loss, none the less.

It didn't take but a couple 'hey you!'s' in the big city to figure out that I wasn't in the army anymore, and that we were not all in this together.

The Kurds in the north of Syria, and I would presume those in the north of Turkey, too, are anarchists of the [Murray Bookchin](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/category/author/murray-bookchin) flavor.
They have federated into various smaller groups, but they work as a whole when they need to do that.

Why a statist, such as Donald Dumpsterfire would not want to help defend anarchists against violent aggression by oppressors is just par for the course.

You wouldn't support an unwilling slave, if you were a slave holder, now would you?

Don't think you are a slave?
Open your seatbelt wearing, insured, tagged, and willing to pull over for flashy blue and red lights eyes, eh?

Freedom to follow the rules is not freedom, derp.

Some rules are unjust.

All rules favor the rich, or they would change them.

Picture this:

GM loans 100 cars to 10 people on the promise that the people pay back 11 cars each.
GM creates no extra cars to pay this 'interest'.
The only way cars circulate is by one or more dealers defaulting on their loans.
Then the survivors can buy at the auction and pay back their interest.

Now, the federal reserve works much the same way,
They create only principal for the loans, never any interest.
In order for a loan to be paid back, with interest, somebody has to go broke.

Every dollar in your pocket is principal on somebody's loan.
If you haven't taken it out in a loan, then somebody else needs it to pay the interest on their loan.

This house of cards is going to fall down.
It's not the first time.
The banksters have played this game for centuries.
Starting when they figured out they only needed 10% of deposits on hand to ride out daily withdrawals.

We can know, nearly to the pair, how many shoes will be needed next year.

This is the main argument I get from the economically educated.

How will we balance supply and demand?
Money does this by raising and lowering prices.
How are you gonna do that without money?

I think we can use the orders for shoes as a reliable indicator of how many shoes need to be produced.

We can grow whatever oils and fuels we need on the wide open spaces of farm land currently paid to lay idle.

Hemp can give us everything that oil gives us, except the $$ per pound that we could have because we grew some hemp in the back yard.

Nearly everybody has a back yard.

It was an unusually windless ride.
Normally, out here on the plains, the wind is a constant 20 miles an hour out of the south.

When it turns to the north, look out.
Arctic air comes from that way.
It comes down out of Denver and heads to Little Rock.

As I travel north first, then return to the south, I guess I shouldn't get to hopeful that the return ride will go as easy as the ride here.

When Massey would come to after losing consciousness, his service dog Butch would be dead — shot and killed by an Okeechobee police officer.

The caller stated there was an unconscious man in his car on the side of the road.

Think about it, dear reader, if you have to prove that you are superior then isn't your superiority already in doubt?

Shouldn't it be self evident?
There shouldn't be any question, in my mind, anyways.
If you were superior, all would see it.

When i first tried using @threespeak in brave, it wouldn't work.
Took me a bit to try dropping the fingerprinting shields.
Apparently, Threespeak does something that conflicts with that particular shield.

I turned it off because tokenbb and steemconnect both conflict with that shield, and if you want to use them, turning off fingerprinting protection is a must.

So, everything was fine, then, some days ago, something changed and threespeak no longer loads.

What gives, @threespeak?

## Lucky you, dear reader!

I know I sometimes get a little wrapped up in things that really touch close to my center of being.

One of those is when you mess with my income.
Stinc has been doing that, literally, for years.

![image.png](https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/freebornangel/EaXLasWV-image.png)

It is not the first time they sold us out to 'investors' for the sake of stripping more btc from what we do here.

I doubt that @ned dumped all his stake.
He intentionally obscured what stake was his when we moved to force his hand last time.

I'm gonna bet that it will take several years to get rid of the stakeholders that are currently selling for pennies.
It's all found money to them.

The only way for the price of steem to fall below 4usd is for folks to sell for less than 4usd.

Now, if I was king of this playground, I would flag back all the rewards I could of folks selling while the price is below 4usd.

But, as I am not, it will be up to me to convince  you, that you should join me in my endeavor to drive up the price.

It's not all that hard.
At 4usd per steem this platform makes entirely more sense than doing this for pennies, imo.

It is really silly, if you do, but don't actively trade it.

Your steem could be earning sp inflation adjustments, curation rewards, fighting abuse, and safe, but instead you store it on the exchange.

I mean, the first lesson behind back up your keys, is keep your coins off exchanges and in a wallet with backed up keys.

You could really do us all a favor if you went to the btm and put in some dollars and pulled some steem off the exchanges and into your wallet.

Once we chase off all the dumpers, the price will rise.

If nobody sells below the price we find consensus at, then we will have a good thing here.
Until then, look to do this for pennies, if that.
