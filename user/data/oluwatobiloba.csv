We need to start acting on the activation of the power from within instead of feeling like a failure all the time.

https://hrexach.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/m9.jpg

Sometimes, victors usually live like victims because they have refused to harness the power of greatness from within.

There comes the power of self believe because what you believe in will determine to a great extent how you will behave.

If you believe today that you are poor, you ultimately become a poor person and if you think everyday that you are a wealthy person, greatness and wealth automatically comes your way.

The basic thing that triggers change in a man's life is not the presence of money but the change of mindset.
Some people like to live as victims of their past because they wouldn't just let go.

When we got into the university, I remember she was one of the first friends I made back then and she was a good person with a wonderful personality, while I stayed in the hostel, she stayed off campus but we were so close that I could sleep at her house and she could also sleep in my room in the hostel.

I meet wonderful people,
with beautiful souls,
they showed me love and encouraged me all through.

I became bold, strong and fearless,
I picked up myself again,
I knew it was time to pick back the plans I had thrown away,
and work on them again.

I introduced one yesterday and that even encouraged me the more.

But, if you have had an encounter with him, you will know that he is strong-willed and his level of strength and faith is out of this world, so he kept on doing what he was doing and he was persistent with it.
He persuaded me to start blogging and eventually I did, they were times when I totally wanted to forget about the account, because after days of brainstorming and doing research, whenever I come up with a post, it usually looks as if no one is interested in the post, because it always has 1 or 2 cents.

I was really worried and I paced around,  I was sure that I might not be given an opportunity to come with my father to the market again so I had to make proper use of every opportunity that I had at this moment to unravel this great misery. 

![download (2).jpeg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmeeMZcynWryr6JM8L1oiQTj2HSSKXXqDDWPPLYmWtCpUv/download%20(2).jpeg)
I decided to step into the crowd immediately my father looked away, I tried all that I could to monitor his every move. 
But,  almost immediately, a pretty tall fair lady walked into the store, I was attracted to her beauty even as a lady and she wore an expensive wrapper.

Just keep calm because there is someone who loves you the way you are.

I told her about how much some people wish that they had her stature,
  I am happy she smiled at the end of the day.

Personality means the way you carry yourself, the way you move around, the way you speak, and most especially the way you handle issues. 

I understand the fact that no one is perfect and we all have our flaws but one great mistake any human can make is to refuse to give room for improvement, grow daily,  improve on your weakness and make yourself a better person everyday .

Personality differs and people can never be the same,  but one thing is certain and that is, if you can give room for improvement, you will always become the best you can be.

I use to argue initially that taking people for granted was gender based,  I felt the male gender was the cruel one that treated ladies like a piece of trash, but my opinion changed when I meet some ladies who treated guys who love them like a piece of trash as well. 

Value the precious individuals with a beautiful heart of gold that you have around you,  please do not take them for granted in any way in order to avoid a life of misery.

 you are very strong,

Those words sounded normal, 
But then I began to think about it and then I realized,
That my Mum has indeed been a strong and lovely person. 
I remember when Dad will upset her so much that she will be moved to tears,
She will look at me and say, 
I am enduring all these for the sake of my kids, 
I don't want them to suffer, 
My mama will sell all that she has because she wants her children to look good, 
She is quick to forgive and highly emotional, 
When I was a teenager,  I misbehaved, 
Dad will hit me so hard, but my Mum will hug me, 
And she will say I know you are not a bad child, 
I know you are going to make me laugh and smile, 
I know you are my future. 

She never spoilt me, 
She taught me how to cook,  wash and make a home, 
I have the attributes of a loving mother even as a young girl because mama raised me well.

In life,  it is not possible for everyone to love you the same way you love them,  there will be a difference definitely, sometimes the attitude of those we love can make us stop loving. 
Yes,  sometimes we give our all to some people, only for us to get jilted and betrayed.  During such periods, we feel like all hope is lost and we even promise ourselves never to love again. 

But,  I have to come to realize that nobody's attitude is good enough to make you stop loving,  it is essential to guard your heart jealously but you also need to love completely. 
Sometimes, you need to learn to forget all that happened in the past and then surrender you heart to love totally,  you only need to watch out to avoid falling into the same trap again.

Do not compare yourself to people who come from a rich family, remember that stealing is never an option, begging is not also an option,  build your reputation. 
As you work hard,  you also need to learn patience, remember that there is no short cut to success.

You might have a rough beginning, and you have to struggle on your own,  but once you have an ambition,  you will realize that waiting for anyone is never an option. See you at the top darlings.

A simple 'thank you might be all you need to save your marriage, save your friendship with that special person, save yourself from danger and the list is endless.

I think one thing that we as humans have the power over is the tounge,  we should be able to control the use and efficiency of our tounge since this little thing called tounge can ruin all we have. 
But sometimes some of this things cannot be done by our own will except we pray and ask the creator to help us tame our tounge.

The radiancy that comes with nature cannot be compared with another, 
Nature is a description of perfection, 
Everything is circled within the ecosystem,
Light and darkness at it's own pace, 
Everything coming out in seasons, 
Plants bearing it's fruit in seasons, 
Land producing it's crop at the right time, 
The skies describes beauty,
The perfection that comes with the mixing of colours and radiancy all around. 
Nature describes glory,  I hope you love it also.

I found out that a woman might not be as strong as a man,  but a good woman is emotionally stronger.

In this rural area,  I have to work as a secondary school teacher and the school building does not have windows or doors. 
Just as we were about to begin classes for the day, a strong wind began to blow and it was followed by a very heavy rain. 
Some of the students whose classrooms were extremely bad had to run to manage with other students whose classrooms were still better.

 ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/vge6nsv1ed.jpg)

Having a positive vibe means having a positive energy towards all that you do. While we have those who spend their time and energy on things that are of no value,  it is important that we learn to convert our energy into things that are productive. 

Rather than putting your zeal into things that are unproductive and not really important,  why not try out something good and beneficial.
There are individuals who are bent on spending their time and energy on ruining others and making them worthless.
My question is what are the things you spend your energy on,  are they things that are productive or not? 
Spend your time today on something good and productive. 
Have a great day.

They treat each other with a high level of disrespect and hatred. Just this morning I overheard the wife telling her husband that, even if he wants to act in stupid ways, he should not do it in the presence of the kids.

Some days back, the husband locked the door to their room leaving the woman outside with wrapper and he went out with the keys.
Neighbours came to plead on her behalf but it fell on deaf ears.

The fight as well as the look of hatred on their faces makes the relationship an unpleasant one.
It is as bad as if the husband finds his wife beating any of their kids, he will beat her back.

There are situations in life that take away every of our of our peace,  pride and happiness and we should never allow such things happen to us. 
No doubt about the fact that life will not always be a bed of roses, but one thing I know is that we can decide to look for a way to get rid of the thorns whenever they show up.
Rather than sitting and getting worried over the things that we cannot control, it is necessary that we wake up to the fact that we can try to get rid of them.

It is important to know that sharing of testimonies help to lift the burden of others, and it also helps to keep the body of Christ in faith.

This testimony encouraged students who were present in the church, and this act surely built up their faith.

I am so sorry today's episode is coming late,  I think this weather is really weighing a lot of people down but I just hope we stay strong. 
Today's episode is going to be a very different one and I want it to be as interactive as possible, so I will be throwing out two questions asked by our guests on the show today. 

I was told to ask these questions and I hope to get lovely viewers participate properly in today's episode. 
The first question is: When two love birds are in a relationship, and one person decides to end the relationship, who do you think feels the pain most, would you say it is the one who insinuated the break up or the one who received the bad news.

As a child, I use to think I will just grow up, have the type of life I want, have a family that is very peaceful and loving and everything will just continue to go on well for me.

But, as a young lady now, I wish I could take back the hands of the clock and erase some of the mistakes I have made while growing up. I have learnt that definite decisions should be made at all times in order to accomplish life goals.
Rather than sitting and crying about some occurrence, I do not like, I just know that the road to success is not an easy one.

For anyone who wants to succeed, we have to always bear in mind that the road to success is not an easy one and we have to strife to accomplish success in everything we do.

I love these pictures because they seem to explain more about what I have written.

Contentment brings peace and respect.  When a man always want more and more,  greed sets in and as such, they begin to get disrespected by others. 

No matter how little you get,  work hard to get it multiplied,  build yourself and make that little become  multiplied because the moment you begin to allow people talk to you in the manner they please because u were not contented with the little you have. 

Become contented, work hard and live well.

When a mother calls her child stupid, it is a normal thing to see that the child begins to act in a stupid way.

Some of these people have reasons to think this way and the reason is because what life throws at them seem to be really unfair situations.

But,  I have realized that even at periods when we feel like giving up,  we can always look for something to keep our faith strong. 
I have also discovered that one way of keeping your faith strong is by adding value to your existence.

Personally, I feel the best way of adding value to your existence is by doing something for humanity .
Doing something productive for humanity adds value to your existence and also makes you beautiful.

### REPORT FROM LAST WEEK'S EPISODE.
We did not have a guest last week which gave me the opportunity to share some of the relationship lessons I have learnt over time, I was excited when I received private messages on what people were able to learn last week and I must say that I am humbled and also honoured.

I learnt something new today which I would love to share with you and it is something about patience.  I have heard about being patient, read about being patient and even talk about being patient. 
The habit of patience is easy to discuss but it is difficult to practice. 

I was supposed to get something today and while I patiently waited for it to get to my turn,  I saw people struggling to get it and some of them were given without stress,  so I got up and then began to struggle for it as well,  during that process,  I had my button removed and I was pushed around only for me to be called upon at the same time when my friend who has been sitting comfortably was called. I thought about all I had to go through which was a very stressful experience.","{""tags"":[""patience"",""writing"",""nigeria"",""wafrica"",""genesisproject""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown"",""community"":""esteem""}",2018-08-02 21:34:48,Patience Is  an esential ingredient in Life.,/patience/@oluwatobiloba/patience-is-an-esentiao-ingrarte-1f575610739a1,2

 ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/1x0t935842.jpg)

Sometimes people go out of their way to do things for us and when we end up not appreciating the things they do,  we break their heart as well as their willingness to ever do anything to please us .

Most times the things that look really minute to us are those things people have gone out of their way to do for us, so no matter how irrelevant it seems to you,  just say thank you. 

It is important that I also mention that the thank you that you will say to someone will not remove anything from you, which means there is no big deal in saying thank you after all.

The truth be told, 
Some of the reasons why some individuals are usually not happy is a serious one and when we hear them we cannot but feel sad for them and wish that life was a little bit more fair to them. 


Some set of individuals tell themselves that they will become happy when they get married, or when they have children, some will even say they will become happy after they have graduated from school. 

But wait for a moment and think,  
What if the graduation, marriage or the much anticipated job never comes through, does that mean you will stay unhappy forever? 

I know that sometimes life can be really unfair to us,  but our decision to attach our happiness to the things we are expecting could make us remain unhappy forever.

I laid on my bed last night as I heard the sound of a heavy downpour on my roof. I wrapped myself with a thick blanket to save myself from the excessive cold. 
I tried to close my eyes to get a good rest because I know the cold will make me have a comfortable sleep. 

I then thought of the fact that some people are under the rain who do not have a shelter over their head or even a thick blanket like mine to cover themselves. 
I wish I could find people like that and then bring them to my home to stay with me or even provide any help in any way I can.

### Relationship Lessons Learnt.

* Do not ever say you are in a serious relationship until it leads to marriage because even marriages fail. 

* Make sure that you pay proper attention to yourself, take care of yourself, always look good and presentable.

But,  one thing is definite and sure, 
We can be strong against all storms of life, 
We can fight and conquer any form of life problems if only we realize that we have the strength to conquer within us. 

No matter what you feel or what you are going through, you should have the mindset of overcoming because you can always overcome any challenge no matter how difficult it seem. 
Stay strong and beautiful dear friend and enjoy the good things of life.

I choose to call these set of people workaholics because they do not mind forfeiting every other thing for work.

These set of humans are those who see everything including their families as secondary while their work remains the main priority. 

At some point in my life,  I guess I became a workaholic as well,  my decision to make it good for myself and to be able to take care of my family was my drive. 
I became stressed out,  I became very pale and at the end of the day, I realized that I spent the money I made on taking care of my health. 
It was since that time I decided to make my health an important factor, I decided never to take work above my health and family especially if you work under someone. 

The most annoying part about working under someone and being a workaholic is that you can be replaced at any time. 
The fact that you work with all you have for someone,  does not mean they cannot get rid ","{""links"":[],""image"":[""https://img.esteem.ws/id5j55vdmr.jpg"",""https://img.esteem.ws/y92timyerw.jpg""],""users"":[""oluwatobiloba"",""gbenga""],""tags"":[""motivation"",""nigeria"",""genesisproject"",""wafrica"",""bigwave""],""app"":""esteem/1.6.0"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""community"":""esteem""}",2018-07-26 19:00:15,The Danger and Benefits of Being a Workaholic.,/motivation/@oluwatobiloba/the-danger-and-benefits-of-being-a-workaholic-baf33ec08696b,0

I once heard a woman say she does not mind suffering all through the time she has to spend on earth,  because she knows she will go to heaven to rest after the suffering on earth.

While I was at work during the day, 
I felt the urge to call my baby sister and then I called her immediately, 
Only for me to find out that my entire family members were involved in a terrible car accident. 
Every member of my immediate family were going on that journey,  I was the only one left aside. 
But,  miraculously the car that was moving on a high speed without tyre came to a stop and the tyre that rolled out on the expressway did not hit anyone. 

I was confused,  I wondered what my life would have been like without my family members. 
They mean so much to me and they have been the only shoulder I have been able to cry on.  I am happy I didn't loose them.

We go through a lot of pain and stress,
We go through lots of hard times as humans. 
But,  through it all a sound of halleluyah comes through. 

All that is required is patience and absolute patience, 
A type of patience that breaks protocols,
A type of patience that has faith mixed with it. 

The sound of halleluyah is assured if only you can have faith,  trust and allow patience be your watch word.

Rainy season are usually periods most people wish for, 
The farmers pray for it to come, 
Others who are not farmers as well wish for it because this is a period where everywhere becomes calm. 
When rain falls, heat disappears and everywhere becomes cool and calm. 

Lovers as well, love this period because it is a period of intimacy for them. 
To have rain fall is a beautiful thing because it makes the environment cool and convenient. 
To have good things come to us naturally is something to be grateful for,  so I am grateful for the opportunity of rainfall.

At what point in a woman's life do you think she will get used to the fact that her husband beats her, is it a crazy idea or something that is normal?

I meet this young damsel some days back and she just kept staring at me,  I opened my arms to receive her and she came running to me. 

It is so unfortunate that most kids here are not properly taken care of and that is because their parents have too many kids,  so the kids grow up to become local farmers as well. 
Very few become educated amongst them.

There is usually a national call for youth corpers to serve their father land after graduation from school.  The service period will last for one year and then after this period the young man or lady begin his or her search to get employed. 

I received this call some weeks back and then I was posted to this village. 
I must confess that I have never seen a place like this before,  as a matter of fact I use to think I was very local until I found this place and the individuals who live therein. 

99 percent of the people who live here are farmers, I mean local farmers who only make use of hoes and cutlass and this makes the work a very stressful one to do. 

My duty in the village is to teach the only private secondary school that exists in the village.

Some people fall in love and their lives become beautiful and meaningful, while others fall in love and they remain in mystery for life.

But now,  I have realized that is only good if the individual involved will know when it is time to stay quiet or if the person just knows that you do not want to talk at that moment. 

 ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/5ofsegkawm.jpg)

There are people who never get tired of talking, they keep talking even if you are not reacting. 
You will think that after that topic they will stay quiet but that will not happen because they just keep bringing up topics over and over again. 

I believe that introverts like to think a lot,  they spend so much time thinking about what their next line of action should be and so on but staying with this person who likes to talk will not give space for that,  because that moment when you wanto relax,  it becomes a duty for a person like that to start talking again.

This place I just moved into which happens to be a local place,  it is time for the harvest of some crops and some of the farmers have little or nothing to harvest. 
There are people who are very much angry about the fact that they have no produce on their farm, but some of them have forgotten that those periods they slept, some other farmers were busy working. 

This is not usually the case,  but most times, we reap what we sow, this means that we obtain our input of effort as a reward.

I know of people who do not have a minute of rest because they are always trying to eavesdrop people's conversation, just to be sure that they are not talking about them. 

There are some people who feel very uncomfortable if they see any gathering of family and friends where they are not invited and the next thing that comes to their mind is,  ""maybe they are talking about me"".

This attitude is very disturbing because when you keep thinking that everyone is against you, you get robbed off of the peace,  satisfaction and the joy that you desire.

There is a total absence of electricity as well,  as we have to depend totally on the availability of a generator to get power supply. 

There are things that are also extremely strange and sometimes exciting about this new environment and one of those things is what I will like to share with you. 

After school closed last week,  my students started running towards a particular direction and when I tried to find out what the problem was,  they told me they had found meat. 
They all moved towards the direction and they started digging until they finally found this bush meat.

This is an environment that there is absence of good network and electricity, so they go to farm and when they get home in the evening, they relax by playing football on the field.

It is usually a combination of very young ones and the matured ones as well,  they shout and argue, but it is usually very obvious that they are catching fun. 

Even under the rain,  they keep playing the football with so much passion and zeal which describes their love for the game and the little period they have to catch fun and take their mind totally off work. 

Picture was taken with my mobile phone.

The issue however is not in childbirth rather it is in the upbringing of the child.

When you stay around the right individuals, it protects you from making wrong decisions. 

The right people are individuals with the mind set of moving forward,  people with the mindset of possibilities,  people with the mindset of greatness and a good future.

Some individuals act as if they have no feelings whatsoever, they disregard people and treat others as though they do not matter at all. 

I have seen deep African homes where it is believed that the son must get married to a lady who will show respect to all his siblings, such homes believe that the new wife must strictly follow every instruction given by her husband's family and she has no right at all to speak when they speak. 
They turn her into a slave in the house,  as they send her on errands around, she also becomes the one who will wash the dishes and clothes.

The more greedy we become, 
We deny the soul of the peace it desires,

Even if we don't get it naturally, 
We will want to do immoral things to get it.

I heard a story of a village owned by a particular family,  the village is indeed very big and owned by just one family but instead of them to sell off their lands as other people will do,  they refused to sell out any of the landed property.

What they do every year is that they give out a particular portion of the land every year for rent,  so people come there to farm and pay them for the land used after a period of one year. 

Natural products obtained from the land are sold out in order to make profit by the family and this has caused the village to remain underdeveloped as no one comes there to build any thing good because they know they cannot purchase lands there.

When all I should do was to get dressed and prepare for work, 
I woke up as usual and almost immediately, 
I heard this strong and loud sound, 
What could that be,  I asked myself? It was the sound of a heavy downpour.

Oh my,  I can't go out under this rain, 
I still had sometime to stay at home, 
So I decided to relax on bed for sometime, 
And off I was to the dreamland. 

My colleague was ready and he came to knock on my window,
Don't tell me you are still sleeping by this time?
He asked surprised,
And I was obviously still on bed until he came to knock. 
I hurried out of bed very fast, 
And I started getting dressed, 
At the end of the day,  I was ten minutes late, 
It is such a cold freezing morning over here.

Anyone could even move around at any time without the fear of being kidnapped.

I saw a level of sincerity which is very high and which might not be found in developed areas. 
I went to purchase fish from a woman and she told me that she could not sell the fish she had to me because it was the one she had left yesterday and she  felt it was not good enough to be sold. 
I know that if the same situation happened in the city, the woman would have looked for a way to make it warm and then sell it. 

I felt really good to know that there are still sincere people and they are found in rural areas.
I have started seeing positivity here and I will keep you informed about how the things go.

Sometimes when I travel,  I see vehicles who have been involved in a miserable road accident and I cannot but say a big thank you to the sustainer of life.

It is obvious that we have no power or strength of our own to save ourselves no matter how smart or intelligent we think we are. 
When we have this at the back of our mind constantly, we will know that we have to be grateful for everything that happens to us which includes safety from one point to another. 

I am grateful for safety, I am grateful because I have moved from one location to another without getting hurt.  It is not because I am so special or I have two heads but I am grateful for safety.

They have been my source of hope,  encouragement and motivation.
If I am to choose another set of family members, I will choose them over and over a million times over. 

When we were younger and we had to manage what we had,  my siblings will always say we know our sister will soon have money and I knew I had to work extra hard in order not to disappoint them.

I get really tired sometimes that apart from listening to music, I just want to take pictures and see the way I look either in the morning or late at night, all thanks to my phone for being a friend. 

The way I look different in almost all my pictures is even more fascinating and that makes me want to take more to see the difference, sometimes I might take five pictures the same day and I will still look different in all of them.

You will agree with me that relationship is the bedrock of the society. 
For every society to stand,  relationships have to be established, it can be a relationship between individuals of the opposite sex,  it could be a relationship between staff and employees, relationship between government and citizens and most importantly relationship between the creator and man.

Betrayal is a painful experience from someone you adore and you expect so much from. 
For you to feel betrayed, it means that you have placed that individual on a large scale so much that you feel that the person can do you no harm. 

I don't think people really get betrayed by people they do not trust as a matter of fact,  without trust,  there will be nothing called betrayal. 
One very bad thing that betrayal can do to a person is to destroy the individuals ego, betrayal can make you take drastic decisions like not being able to love and trust ever again.

Due to circumstances, some people have been made to solely rely on whatsoever  comes their way and some others due to ignorance have been made to eat whatever they get to eat. 
Some people eat quantity and not quality,  eating in large pieces and doing it the wrong way.

The disadvantage of not eating properly cannot be over mentioned because not eating the right way affects the body of humans so much that it could result into having a disease and even death. 

It is necessary that we take our focus off the quantity of food and begin to think towards the direction of proper feeding which deals with quality. Take into consideration whatever you consume because in a way,  it describes your appearance.

### About Last Week. 
As you know,  I like to give you feedback about what happened last week. 
I spoke with Lizzy and she had a way to get through to her friend's mother to inform her about everything that has been ongoing in school. 
The smart mother decided to pay her daughter a surprise visit and what she saw was one that made her act. 
Lizzy was happy she was able to help save her friend in her own little way and she has sent me to say thank you for your timely advice and encouragement.

This picture was taken unaware when I got my Techno L9+ and my friend wanted to test the camera. I was given cornflakes at the slot for purchasing the phone. 

I was really tired that day and it is one of those period when I feel I have no special place to go to so I can rock my natural hair. 

And those periodic pimples had to just show themselves that day. 
While scanning through my gallery today,  I found the picture and I felt I should share it.

I was supposed to meet with someone to make some enquiries about certain things and when I finally meet with the man, I realized he was a successful young man who had a wife and two lovely daughters.

We reached an agreement and we decided that we could work together and it was fine by me. Until I realized that the young man wanted to start giving a strange attitude, I just laughed at him when I realized he was trying to fool around because he felt he had money to spend.

I then realized for the first time the reason why Ladies of my age fall very easily for married men, the love and care they will promise to shower, you know they already have a marriage experience, so the way they will treat you will be different from the way a young hustling guy will treat you.

But then, I got thinking again.

How I wish I was a little smarter,
how I wish I knew better,
how I wish I was a little wiser,
all this would not have happened.

I stood from a distance, as I saw those whom I have called friends betray me,
I watched from a distance as I saw them mock me,
I watched from a distance and I observed that they saw me burning and they turned their faces away.

Oh, how cruel can you be earth?
how cruel can you be oh nature?
why have you decided to turn against me,
what offence have I committed to receive such treatment?

It was a stressful day and we were supposed to get our school receipt after running around to get the school fees paid.
The real gist is that if you are opportune to pay your school fees early in my school, then you can get your school fee receipt without stress because you will just walk into the bursar's office and the secretary to the bursar will hand over your school receipt to you.

### How We Meet.
The first time I meet this amazing woman was when I attended the Ibadan meet-up and she came to pick us up when we arrived, I only said hi to her, but I am more of an observer when I meet people for the first time, so I sat at a corner as I watched her discuss with @fisteganos, @gbenga and some other wonderful steemians.

I fell in love with her personality that instant and I really adored her, I liked the fact that she was pretty and outspoken, I also noticed that she was an intelligent person.
I told my best friend that day of how much I liked the pretty woman we just meet and he just smiled.

The following day, I got up really early and I got dressed in a wonderful short gown my Mum had bought for me and I headed straight for my (supposed parent's room), my father just started getting dressed, so I just sat on the bed and I wore a very calm look that will make him allow me to follow him to the market.

I hopped into the lorry after father finished dressing up and I opened my eyes to get a glimpse of everything that is going on on the road, my father was expecting me to sleep because it was a long drive but I was really nervous, I wanted to know if I will meet any of my family members I have not seen for some time now.

I was down and weak,
my attitude changed towards everyone around me,
I felt stupid and insulted.

I lost my smile and laughter,
my neighbours kept asking me what the problem was,
but I could not tell anyone, I kept it all to myself,
I was dying slowly.

I then realized that I had to forgive and make myself happy,
I realized that I was going to ruin myself if I don't forgive,
I realized that if I wanted to be happy, I had to forgive,
and then move on with life,
it was a difficult task to do I must confess.

This picture was taken during my first year in the university, it was one of those days when we woke up pretty early and rushed to the classroom only for us to wait all day for a lecturer that never comes.
Those days are usually very annoying because you might be having a good and beautiful sleep when your alarm will remind you that you have a class to attend, as a serious fresher (as we were called) you will have to jump out of bed and rush to the classroom, only for you to hear the voice of another lecturer asking you to leave the hall because he wants to use it for his own period.

Then we got to know each other and her personality was amazing. Even if I do most of the talking whenever we are together, I have been able to learn somethings from her as well.

My cruh is a 'no-nonsense' lady and she will never bring down her standard for anyone, she does whatsoever is in her mind as long as she feels at peace with it. She is pretty sturbborn (I think I like that) because it has made everyone around her know and love her for whom she really is.

http://lissarankin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Orlando-277x300.jpg

Let the question series begin:
When was the last time you put a smile on someone's face?

When was the last time you made someone laugh really hard?

When was the last time you got sincere with yourself and you had the guts to tell yourself the truth?

when was the last time you told your neighbour the truth?

When was the last time you loved?

If you are to relocate from your residential area now, what will be neighbour reaction?

Will they be filled with excitement that the troublemaker is finally going to leave?

Or will they cry and ask you to stay back?

What about if you leave the earth today, what will become of your memories?

Alright, friends, it's another beautiful Saturday and I am really happy to welcome you to the second episode of an awesome programme on the steem blockchain.
Mr Ezekiel whose case was treated last week sent me to say a very big thank you to everyone, your advice was taken and right now Mr Ezekiel is better and stronger, he has learned to stop thinking about the Lady who broke his heart and he is hell-bent on making himself a better person. The last time I spoke with him, he sounded very happy and that made me smile.

The programme kicked off last week when the first episode was introduced and the response was marvellous,  I told you last week that we are open for adjustment and improvement, some people gave us some things to work on, and yes we have improved on that aspect and that is the reason why today's episode is going to be amazing

The new way customers react is simply: you have to give them what they want, the exact way they want it, or within a twinkle of an eye, they have gone somewhere else.
Power is no longer with the entrepreneurs/ sellers as it use to be before, it is now in the hands of those who purchase and that is the customers.

The last money I had in my account was what I used to make a little cake for him and a small gift as well and he decided that he just wanted to spend the day with me and since we did not have enough money we went to OAU, we visited the zoo (which was almost empty) but I was scared at the sight of the roaring lion and it was just the both of us in the zoo, we laughed and we had an amazing time together.

I think this picture was one of my favourite back then, it was taken after a Sunday service and I was really excited about that Sunday service because I just joined the choir group that month and I was given the opportunity to lead a Hausa song.

My fellowship was the largest the school had, with a great number of choir members with super amazing voices, I decided to join the choir group so that I will participate in the voice training and improve on my voice.

This post is inspired by the sad story I heard today and I felt it was important that I shared it because it might help someone.

There was a young lady who went to a boarding house at a very young age and she started developing unusual stomach abdominal pain, she was one who liked to keep to herself, so she decided not to tell anyone about it.
The unusual pain started during her secondary school days but she kept it a secret until she got to the university and the pain got even worse.

The life of greatness and success that you desire is only achievable if you are willing to build up yourself and give all that it takes to achieve what you want. 

There is nothing you desire that cannot be attained,  that is one fact you should understand, hold on to your dreams and believe in the great power of positivism coming out in every corner. 

The sky is the limit for anyone who believes in the achievement of greatness and is also ready to work hard at it.

The feeling of having a sister is amazing,
especially when it is a younger one,
that uses a similar size of cloth and shoe with you,
that makes her want to steal everything attractive that you have.

The aspect of argument and constant fight.
is usually very interesting too,
when she wants to be the one to win all the time.

I really love the fact that I have a kid sister who likes to disturb,
every time my phone rings,
she always wants to know the person at the other end,
and sometimes when I do not want her to know who the person is,
we end up fighting for the phone,
until the call finally drops.

The part I love most is when she tells me about
those boys that disturb her in school,
and how excited she is to tell them,
that she does not need their money,
because she has a big sister.

I just love her to the moon,
and so I decided to write this,

I think I did not have enough money to get a weavon for my hair that day, so the lady in the saloon advised that I could just relax my hair and give it a simple setting that could still last for a while before I get the money to make another hair.

I succumbed to her advice and I had my hair relaxed after the relaxer was washed off, it was rolled into different segments and pinned with rollers, a setting spray was added as well, and then the biggest part came, I had to put my hair under the drier.

he said he loved me and he planted a kiss on my forehead,
I was too cold to resist.

Immediately we got off the lonely bushy path, I ran into the arms of Akanni, the one who said he likes me.
What is the problem? he asked me, instead of me to give him a reply I decided to ask him a question too, do you know that young man coming behind us, I asked him?
Of course, I do, hope he did not hurt you, are you sure that you are fine? he started to sound worried. I am very fine, just take me home. When the tall full beared guy saw me with someone else, he went his own way. I was happy he did not make any trouble because some guy in my other life where I think I really belong, would have just started a fight with him.

You can imagine that I have lived with my parents around Abuja for more than 15 years and I have never had the opportunity to visit this region, so going there this very day was a big one for me.

The reason why I have never visited this area is simply that I do not have the money to pay the required bills around here, but I am really excited that I finally got to visit the area.
The next thing on my mind right now is to bring my siblings over here to so that they can get a view of the enironment, you know that family comes first for me.

What I have to tell you today is something that amazed me so much. 

I was in my room one afternoon trying to get some rest when suddenly I started hearing unusual voices, one of them was saying:I will slap you,  will you shut up your silly mouth,  where is your room,  who owns these gadgets? and other questions. 

What could the problem be, I remained puzzled in my room  and because I was eager to know what was going on,  I peeped through the window and then I saw gun men holding my neighbor. 

Although we are not in talking terms because he does not answer whenever I greet him, maybe because he feels I am too small or maybe because he owns a car and I don't have one.  (I have no idea what his reason could be). 

I peeped through the curtains in my room and I watched as they put handcuff on his hands and they took him away.

Later in the day,  we got to know that he went to steal with his gang members ","{""links"":[""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=imgres&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwitp4_VutfZAhUGzKQKHcOCBkcQjRx6BAgAEAY&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgossip.naija.ng%2F1091351-lady-threatens-mess-boyfriends-life-dumped-her.html&psig=AOvVaw1QhJ76BOwu8J73PxLeTra7&ust=1520417488888873""],""image"":[""https://steemitimages.com/DQmd1ABLnSjGtkmfgSvaNb3XzhQYb4ANgQho3Dj6vrWJkHr/megs%20toon2%20-%20Copy.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://img.esteem.ws/k38amzzr6w.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmcGTgE9ztQ7QmWESyE7uVqLrUqfbAa1fsTCod6dmsFYjP/GENERIC.gif""],""users"":[""Oluwatobiloba"",""jodipamungkas"",""gbenga""],""tags"":[""writing"",""nigeria"",""event"",""africa"",""starch""],""app"":""esteem/1.5.1"",""format"":""markdown+html"",""community"":""esteem""}",2018-03-07 14:35:06,How Possible Is It For My Neighbor With A Cool Face To Be A Thief.,/writing/@oluwatobiloba/how-possible-is-it-for-my-neighbor-with-a-cool-face-to-be-a-thief-bdadd516664a9,4

I became interested in the issue and the Lady told me that there was a guy she liked but she just saw that he was getting married to someone else next week.

She was really crying as she lamented about being an object that men have used and dumped on several occasions. I became interested in her case, so I sat close to her and I pleaded with her to stop crying, but she went further, this is not the first time, you will not understand.

This was a very large gathering, the uyo meet-up is the largest gathering I have attended but I am say that this is a very large gathering as well.

One great lesson I learnt from this meet-up is that, steemit is not all about the amount of money you have in your wallet, it is more about adding value, it is about your personality. I must confess that I really felt loved during the meet-up and I am grateful to everyone who made that possible.

During the meet-up, there were newbies there, who of course wanted to meet reputable steemians and maybe most importantly those who made more money, a lady looked at me towards the end of the programme and she said to me","{""video"":{""info"":{""title"":""VID_20180224_181952"",""snaphash"":""Qmd4JAPFatXgRGL5AaG1T9qsiZcJ5n1n7twwPiyg6FvkZP"",""author"":""oluwatobiloba"",""permlink"":""4lhpj0l2"",""duration"":83.476854,""filesize"":43805024,""spritehash"":""QmWb8uTtQ1Ky5B46UhKZGoeu7JC7GzusWvEQuacmiecByB""},""content"":{""videohash"":""QmVwtgasCNcVwFHitif4fLodniu52JsWVkiS6x8cHf9ZJo"",""video480hash"":""QmZSUfTjLoX3EhRojdvv8YHUbMc97pHTmeuHXcfyumbvRz"",""magnet"":"""",""description"":""The Steem-Ibadan Meet up was a Great One, I Loved Every Moment and I Learnt Something Great Too."",""tags"":[""dtube"",""promo-steem"",""community"",""nigeria""]},""_id"":""bb5d9a4ebf64f556375783fa7c940454""},""tags"":[""dtube"",""promo-steem"",""community"",""nigeria""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""image"":[""https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTKABHf3dRuaYTetzyDFgStyQtnSB4QPCF2KekaC4Zuh6""],""links"":[""https://d.tube/#!/v/oluwatobiloba/4lhpj0l2"",""https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVwtgasCNcVwFHitif4fLodniu52JsWVkiS6x8cHf9ZJo""],""format"":""markdown""}",2018-02-26 13:47:21,"The Ibadan Steemit Meet-up Was A Great One, I Enjoyed Every Bit Of It, I Learnt Something Great and My Plea.",/dtube/@oluwatobiloba/4lhpj0l2,8

This adage can be applied to the chemistry that plays out between two lover birds. Love is a fire that burns without setting it ablaze, love is invincible, magical and unconditional.

Sola, a graduate of English department at Ambrose Ali University was posted to Ogun state for his service year  early last year after he has completed his Bs.c program.

The principle behind living a life filled with Success is to stop procrastinating, the idea of procrastination is a great destiny destroyer. 

 ![image](https://img.esteem.ws/76yjf1m1z6.jpg)

The moment you stop Procastinatng,it is one major enemy down already and then you can begin to work on other things. 


It is really necessary that you learn to improve on your abilities daily,  do not give room for idleness or laziness,  always have it in mind that the type of people that the world needs are those who have spent time to grow themselves and also work hard in the place of discipline. If you do not develop yourself,  no one will value you. 

Place a high value on yourself because the higher your value then the higher the demand you attract to yourself.

Yes, my friend there are different levels in life and we all want to go from one level of achievement to the other, but we fail to realize that most of these things needs us to be ready for them,

https://cdn.vectorstock.com/i/thumb-large/57/71/businessman-running-for-achievement-the-success-vector-16175771.jpg

Little wonder the reason why so many of us misuse opportunities, when we get them. It is because we have not prepared ourselves well enough for the next stage in life that we desire to attain.

So my friend, for that next level or next stage in life, you have to get properly prepared for it, that way you will make the best out of life.

She is lovely and highly intelligent, when we were kids my parents use to insult me a lot for not being able to read like her because she had loved to read right from childhood and that has not changed up till date.

I am saying thank you for giving me the opportunity to be a big sister to you and to practice motherhood with you (because she says I behave like a mother). She said I am her best friend and I really feel flattered to hear that.

He can love for Africa, he is really a lover boy !!!(please don't tell him I said that oh), but I like him for that anyways, I love people who love genuinely and who really have the gods to show that their love is for real.

From the story we heard, it was said that they really loved each other and even when the girl's parent will not have them get married because of difference in religious belief, they eloped together to get married. Their love grew every day and people envied them.

After some time, they started fighting and what everyone thought to be a normal marital issue turned into something big, because a whole week will not pass by without them getting involved in a fight that people will come help them settle.

We have canceled some important occasions to fear and as well we have avoided taking a certain risk that will move our lives forward just because we are scared.

### A Case Study.
I have a friend who did not step out of the university all through her stay for the period of four years, she stayed indoors and never attended any social gathering because she was scared that something will happen to her on the way or even at the event.

@ehiboss as well wrote a post some days back and he emphasized on the importance of doing without makeup sometimes, I am not a makeup addict, I cannot even do a proper makeup on my face without the assistance of my friend.

Today, I decided to make my natural hair without attachment or any additives.
I took this pictures without any makeup, not even powder or lipstick.
I don't know if I look good, that will be left for you to judge as I share the pictures I took today with you. Enjoy!!!

Self-development helps you improve and it makes you become a better person in all that you do and say.
You really have to become committed to growth if you want to grow.

And one more thing is that you have to stop limiting yourself to the things that you can do, what is believable is achievable, whatsoever you do not believe you can achieve, you can never achieve it, so let the journey to the pursuit of excellence begins from your mind and develop yourself daily to become a better person.

I can never forget the day you were trying to teach me how to prepare a particular food and your spilled hot water on yourself, I never said sorry because I felt it served you right for been wicked to me, my Dad got very angry at me and started floging me but you still pleaded with him to leave me alone as I was only having a childish mentality.

This illustration is what happens everywhere and the interpretation is just that every kid has the right to make mistakes except a preachers kid and this is really amazing and very questioning, does it mean that it is not the same blood that flows in a normal kid that flows in a preachers kid?

The level of perfection expected by the society from the parents is as well transferred to the innocent child who just wants to grow and have a normal life like every other kid.

One of my female friends came home one day and she began to tell us that her Mum has been down because her husband, who promised to love her forever, has been caught cheating.
The issue has really become a serious one as it seems as if the men we have in this generation just take it as a pleasure to break promises they have made to the woman they claim to love.

There is no doubt that Nigeria is a blessed and great nation with very hardworking citizens, one thing about Nigerians is our ability to survive in whatsoever condition and weather.
I have never seen any type of community or country like Nigeria that has citizens who can survive amidst hunger, pain and all.

He tells you that adultery is wrong according to the good book and even the sighting of a woman in a strange way is wrong.

Some people go through a lot of hard times and they do not get anyone to help them come out of the situation, but a healthy act of help rendered by an individual makes all the difference.

# The Times When You Need to Render Help
The act of rendering help is a thing that should not be determined by time and period because it is something we need to do at all times. Whenever we see someone who needs help or assistance in any way or any area, we should always be ready to assist.

I reached for my phone as I took a picture of the both of them cuddling each other from a distance.

The way we see mountains is the way it will be to us, some of us think we cannot make it and that has become our mentality towards life.

A man can be blessed with the things of the mountain instead of being scared of the mountain. 
The mountain has so many benefits but it only depends on your ability to harness and try to understand it before you could get those benefits.

For anyone who desires greatness and the achievement of life success, then the individual must know that he or she cannot just operate on the same level with everyone else.

However, the steps taken should not be one that is wicked, because in the pursuit of life achievement some people do not mind destroying others just to enable them to get to the top.

# The Fault of The Parents
Sometimes the parents are at fault because instead of making the children see the fact that they care about them, they make them see the side of being furious instead.

I am pretty much aware of the fact that some parents believe in the fact that if there are continual joy and happiness in the home it means the kid is spoilt, they believe that if the kids are not free with their parents that means they are doing their job as a good parent properly.

If a thousand people are asked about how they want their future to be, a thousand individuals will tell you that they want a perfect future where they will have no problem, a perfect future where they will have people who will serve them, a perfect future where they will have everything they desire to their dispensation.

The life of royalty is one that should greatly be admirable because we feel that they have all that they need, we feel they are satisfied with the position that they are and so we really want to be like them.

I was really happy that I could just think of a song by my self and if my siblings liked it then it means that some other people out there will like it as well.

But, one thing that shocked me to my bone was when I was passing one day in another neighborhood different from ours and I heard someone else singing my song.

A mother is someone who has the best interest of her child at heart, even if not for any reason she will think about the stress she had to go through for nine months and as well the pains of delivery.

A mother will not want to abandon or forsake her child for whatsoever reason, instead she will hold firm and she will always find a reason why she should not give up on the child no matter how frustrating the child is. Although, it has been realized that some mothers are very heartless and they can abandon  their kids with anyone at any time. We have even heard of cases of mothers who kill their kids because they do not have enough money to take care of them, but today I am not talking about those  talking about such mothers.

Gift thought about the next line of action to be blocking every necessary route where help will come from for her husband, she needed to get fast at it because time was no longer on her side.
She taught of killing his mistress after the experience of so much pain but then she thought again that if she should kill her, she will have the power to do things as she does now, so she asked her friends and she was told that it is only those who did good while they were on earth that will posses the type of power she posses presently but those who did evil or wickedness while they were alive will have no such power and they will not even stay here as they have a different place where they belong.

She was happy to hear that, so she allowed her husband's mistress to go through just a little more pain until she was sure that her husband had spent all that he had on her and he even had debt on ground, she then killed her.

I wanted to just see an happy marriage that will change my mindset about married people, I wanted to see a marriage that will be perfect and without stress, a marriage where the both parties will respect each other, a marriage where everything will work out just fine, but even the ones who look happy from the outside are going through a lot of terrible sit","{""tags"":[""marriages"",""life"",""love"",""nigeria"",""africa""],""image"":[""http://www.hitchedmag.com/images/article/life_advice_marriagemyth_06302010.jpg"",""https://marriagemissions.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Fighting-Fair-Graphic-stock-_StQWvdRRSs-copy.jpg""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=imgres&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiYwrru47XWAhXDtRQKHcEZANkQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hitchedmag.com%2Farticle.php%3Fid%3D1009&psig=AFQjCNEr-eXKJMmIN4ZzyFr7QLxmdZdiMg&ust=1506066177362219"",""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=imgres&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjKyKH447XWAhWMsxQKHYyyBVkQjRwIBw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarriagemissions.com%2Fdealing-with-issues-in-marriage-message-112%2F&psig=AFQjCNFkTaICi2zv-CSKjYnTfjJTdsK4Bg&ust=1506066198022436""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-09-21 07:50:27,Imperfect Marriages,/marriages/@oluwatobiloba/imperfect-marriages,14

I have a class mate who feels he is not obliged to apologies for anything he does wrong, he did something wrong to his girl friend in my presence one day and I was trying to tell him to apologize to her, he immediately replied by saying he does not say sorry to anybody he went further by telling me that he constantly has issues with his Dad at home just because he cannot say he is sorry.

The Lady who happened to be his girl friend and who could not handle the insult any longer, told him she was done with the relationship and she walked out, I tried talking to him to call her back and at least just say he is sorry. He immediately said to me Tobi I have broken up with 3 other ladies because of this same issue of not being able to say sorry and I just stood at a spot confused and amazed at how someone will not be able to say sorry .

The fulfillment of your purpose in life is determined by hard work and persistence.


Whatever laid down goals you have in life should prompt hard work and guide you to destiny fulfilment.

You can begin to make plans for what you want your future to be by making proper plans now. Everything hidden inside of you  has been kept there to enable you fulfil basic life purpose.

Your Destiny is your predetermined destination. Movement to purpose fulfilment is a gradual and unfailing process.

Most of the people I get to stay with are married people and during those periods of my visitation I have seen some of them go through some marital issues (which is a normal phenomenon) since they do not come from the same background, they are bound to have misunderstanding sometimes.
These visitations have allowed me make some decisions about how I want to live my live . So many great lessons have as well been learned.

During the course of one of those visitations, I stayed with a very beautiful Aunt who used her beauty to get all that she wanted,I use to sneak to her house sometimes from  school without the consent of my Mum whenever I wanted to collect money from her.

Putting the act of love into action involves seeing someone in need and lifting a hand of help to assist the fellow.
So many of us claim that we love people especially those that we are in a relationship with but the real test of love comes up whenever you have to express it.

One will remain stuck in life if the act of appreciation is not practiced.
One reason why people are ingrate is because they feel; everyone should be responsible for their happiness.

Some people always fail to be grateful because they prefer to live their lives as victims of circumstances.


Gratitude has the power to open doors of greatness .
Gratitude has the power to open doors of opportunities.

Gratitude has the ability to get someone connected with favor.

He went further by saying, if as a guy he can cook then he sees no reason why any lady should not know how to cook.

Another guy agreed to what he said and continued by saying do you expect a man to go out to bring money and still not meet a good meal.

I am not saying it is proper for a lady not to know how to cook, but why is it one sided, why is it that every guy who doesn't know how to cook too be regarded as been useless?.

I have argued constantly with my friends that this world we live in,is a Man's world especially in Nigeria where the wife is expected to act as the maid in the home.

It is a beautiful morning at this side of the world and what Nigerians love to do is to greet and greet properly.
Nigerians have the habit of greeting until you get frustrated.
We have different slang's of greeting for every occasion.

There are majorly three ethnic groups in Nigeria and they include;

# The Yoruba's

The Yoruba's are believed to be the most cultured ethnic group in Nigeria.
They Yoruba females usually go down on their knees to greet, while the male  prostrate.

I am sure that we all have heard at a point in our lives that the world is in circles and what we give into life is what we will have back in return, but we might not have really taken it into proper consideration.

It is time for humans to wake up and realize that we have the power to determine how we want our future to be by the way we act and treat others now, when people come to that actualization, the world will then become more bearable and a safer place to live in.

It is a process of the mind that reflects in your action and your works. Thoughts can either make or break you and it has the ability to change you from being a worse individual into a better person.

# Some kings think like slave and some slaves think like kings.

The mind set of a king could either reduce him to a nobody or allow him maintain his position as the king  and the mindset of a slave as well could either let him remain as a slave or take him to the position of royalty.

Africa is a very great continent with so much powers to their dispensation, it is the world's second most populous and second largest nation. 

We are usually described as the major blacks and it is believed that we use our powers to carry out different activities which might be good or bad.

Nigeria is where I can speak of properly because I am a full blooded Nigerian. 
We are usually described as the giant of Africa and truly we are, we have the powers to do good and evil.

Nigeria has so many gods as each ethnic group believes in their own god/goddess. We have over 401 dieties usually referred to as Orisa. The Yoruba community alone has a long list of gods/goddess ranging from Osun- the river goddess to 
Ogun- the ruler of iron 
Sago - the ruler of thunder 
Sopono- ruler over diseases, and so many others.

Friends can either help one to fulfill destiny or either destroy one's plan and destiny, it depends on the type of friends you have decided to keep.

Real and true friends push you forward to the actualization of your dreams, they help you at periods when you need help, they are supportive and dependable.

Fake friends are usually the opposite of the real ones, even when you tell them about your plans,they will look for every possible means to pull you down. They want  to be the only successful one so even if you die in poverty, it doesn't matter to them, the only reason why they remain your friend is because of whatever you have to offer them.

I remember growing up when my Mum buys me a new cloth, I will gently fold it in my box and just stare at it days after days admiring it and waiting for a perfect day to put it on, i will smile to myself when I imagine how my friends will say @oluwatobiloba has a new cloth and they will say it is really nice, I will tell my mum to get me something similar.

Monica was really confused as she sighted her lovely  husband, she was scared and obviously shaky she tried to put herself  together and helped him into the bedroom where  she put off his  dirty and smelly clothes  and laid him down to sleep. She couldn’t sleep all through the night as her disturbed mind gave her different interpretations of what the problem might be.

It is really important to know that it is not just enough to eat but it is most important to eat well, we need to move our gaze from eating quantity to start eating quality.

We need to learn to consume a wide variety of food rather than just focusing on specific dietary routine all the time, some people have the mentality that they can only eat well when they have a lot of money but that is untrue because one can eat a balanced meal with less cash.

It is of no doubt that rising from the top to the bottom is not easy for someone who does not come from a wealthy or a royal family but certain decisions need to be made in order to leave the category of being poor and start living a good life.

 People who have self-pity believe that they have suffered too much beyond faith and there is no hope for them anymore thereby resulting into laziness because they believe that they cannot be relevant in the society.

 Self pity can destroy one's spirit , ego and believe.

Florida was a beautiful and attractive lady who believed that she could get whatever she wanted through her beauty, she manipulated things without being caught, was an expert in deceit, was very good at breaking people's homes because she was really good at making married men feel that they had made the wrong choice and they in turn get tired of their wives.
She was an expert in making young and innocent children fatherless and even their wives widows when the men come back to their senses and realize that the lady (Florida) that they have willed all their life to was no where to be found thereby resulting into an heart attack.

A will means to act decisively on one's desire,  which implies that it is not good enough to think or have ideas the most important thing is to act on it. 
Your will describes your inner drive. 

The first step to the activation of will Power is self discovery.  Know that you are bold,  you are strong,  you are unstoppable and you are unique.

Dishonesty has become the order of the day and a normality in the society.It is now odd to speak the truth or when you even speak the truth, you are seen as been over spiritual. 
Although, i feel that there are so many reasons why people tell lies but no matter what situation we find ourselves, we should try to remain truthful  no matter what it might cost us (personal opinion anyways) , the beginning of corruption is when one starts telling lies.
Another level of dishonesty is when you cannot even tell yourself the truth, that implies that you deceive yourself and others as well.
http://www.jimknaggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/honesty_by_brambo92-d3yhs0o-300x240.jpg
My point is that humans should learn to be truthful to each other and most importantly to themselves, it begins from the home which is the smallest unit of life, be sincere with your partners, your kids and friends.

People should learn not to always allow their emotions rule over their brain, let's get smart, sensible and reasonable.
The fact that your heart wants to remain fixed to that guy or lady should not determine your inability to ignore your brain that is telling you to ''flee'' from that abusive and insulting relationship

 Procrastination is what gives birth to laziness, it puts one in a tight position and then you keep thinking that you have all the time in the world to do that which you were supposed to do immediately when it crossed your mind.
Some basic ways to stop this bad attitude known as procrastination is ;
 To admit that it is a bad habit that you have grown with over the years and be ready to have a change of heart.
Tell your friends to watch you and caution you whenever you are it again.
Make a list of all you want to achieve daily and o stick to it

oluwatobiloba,hiv-and-aids,HIV AND AIDS,medicine,"In June 1981 scientists published the first report of a mysterious and fatal illness that initially appeared to affect only homosexual men. Subsequent early reports speculated that this illness resulted from homosexual men’s sexual activity and, possibly, recreational drug use. In the months that followed, however, this same illness was diagnosed in newborns, children, men, and women, a pattern strongly suggesting a blood-borne infection as the cause of the observed illness. The illness was initially identified by several terms (e.g., “gay bowel syndrome,” “lymphadenopathy virus (LAV),” and AIDS-associated retrovirus (ARV), but by 1982 this disease came to be known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) because of the impact of the infectious agent, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), on an infected person’s immune system. Since about 1995 the term HIV disease has been used to describe the condition of HIV infected persons from the point of early infection through the development of AIDS.

Abortion is one of the most emotional and divisive moral issues of twenty-first-century American life. Consensus has not been reached on the numerous questions that swirl around the subject, including whether or not a woman has the right to choose a legal abortion, and under what conditions; the role of parents if she is not legally an adult; and the roles of the state and religion having veto power. In addition, the questions of when life begins and at what point it should be protected remain controversial.

Strictly defined, abortion is the expulsion or removal of an embryo or fetus from the uterus before it has developed sufficiently to survive outside the mother (before viability). As commonly used, the term abortion refers only to artificially induced expulsions caused by mechanical means","{""tags"":[""medicine"",""abortion"",""biology""],""image"":[""https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FrAoTyheS5Y/maxresdefault.jpg""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-04-19 21:39:57,ABORTION - ALL IN ALL,/medicine/@oluwatobiloba/abortion-all-in-all,0

Employees are sometimes forced to behave in ways that are really questioning, they are forced to act in very strange ways and this is because their employers treat them like slaves.

It is not new that some employees are very rude, lazy and disrespectful but on other occasions, some of them come to work with the mindset of giving their best, until they come in contact with that very rude and annoying boss, their countenance fall and they begin to mosbehave.

There was a case to settle, and usually the community leaders and the Baale will settle the issue.

I sat properly in order to get the full story of the event and I am definitely going to share it with you.
It was a big issue within a man and his wife. This man has two wives but the current problem was between him and the first woman he got married to.

They have obviously been having issues for a very long time, the man had chosen the second wife over the first and he has abandoned the first wife in the process.

They felt I must be a very rich kid who could afford to eat chicken everyday and even at her convenience whenever she wishes.

The first thing I learnt is the importance and relevance of respect in a relationship.
Respect has an active role to play in matters of the heart, no matter how much you both long to stay with each other, the absence of respect will make your stay hell on earth.

It is however important to note that men have EGO, so this falls back on the function of a woman.
The respect given should be a mutual one, but as ladies we need to know that the responsibility of giving respect to our spouses lies heavily upon our shoulders, we really need to shower them the respect ","{""tags"":[""relationship"",""blog"",""nigeria"",""wafrica""],""users"":[""tobi""],""image"":[""https://markmanson.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/relationship-advice-cover-2.jpg""],""links"":[""https://markmanson.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/relationship-advice-cover-2.jpg""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2019-02-06 16:19:42,Relationship Issues.....Matters of the Heart.,/relationship/@oluwatobiloba/relationship-issues-matters-of-the-heart,2

Today's relationship gist is about two young love birds, the issue was reported by the lady who feels scared that the young man she broke up with might end up doing something bad to himself.
Here is the full story friends.....

A friend gave someone my number and we started talking, I haven't met him before but I just liked his sense of humour! 
He asked me out and I said yes! I know it's not right, we haven't met before.

I've been contemplating whether to continue the relationship or to meet him, it was a hard choice. 
I decided to leave him!

The women tie their wrappers to their chest as they prepare food for their husbands and children.

A two coloured skin is a skin that has two different colour in it, this is not in anyway a skin disease or skin problem, but it is a reaction that comes with using certain body lotions.

### Possible Reasons for Having a Two Coloured Skin.

There are people who naturally do not have the same colour all through their body, one part of the body may be a little darker than the other probably as a result if exposing certain part of the body to the sun while the other part is covered from the sun.
However, there is a more common reason why some people have this two coloured skin, and the reason is because they want to change their skin colour.
Some people do not feel comfortable with their skin colour, so they usually want to do all they can to change it.

I regret the day I meet you, and other horrible things.

People react towards the result of failure in different ways, while we have some people who just sit and get deep in thought, we have others who will scream and jump, gathering the attention of everyone.
There are people who will collapse, who will break down, cut themselves or hurt themselves in several ways etc.

For Ladies especially, you have to get married in order to show that are truly successful (that is for most African parents), as long as they are concerned, there is no amount of success or happiness you can claim to have achieved without marriage.

A lot of people do not have an idea as to what entrepreneurs are going through but all customers want is that they should be satisfied at all cost.
