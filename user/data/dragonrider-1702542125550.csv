I summoned the courage to write my first post today. I have tried several times to write this post earlier but I just kept telling myself ""boy, don't you think you've got to learn the rope? You've got to learn and study how things are done here a lil'bit more"". Whenever I hear that voice in my head I would say maybe not today and just clear whatever I have typed, intending to post. 

So, basically I have been looking around here for some time now,  doing nothing but watching. Today again, I was watching as usual, suddenly something came over me and I said to **Draco** my dear dragon, boy,  let's ride straight into Steemit,  and here we are.
___
## How I Got To Know About Steemit
I stumbled on Steemit by chance, it was a typical chance encounter. I was making research about cryptocurrencies online and Viola! Steemit popped up, I clicked on the link, found myself on Steemit website, read the FAQ, the White and Blue Papers and explored everything there is to explore. 
Steemit is an uncharted territory to me and I hope to meet awesome people here and make great friends.

# About Me
My name is **Dramirs**, a dragon lord from the ancient city of **Drakul** in a planet where Dragons roam freely on the streets as your pets do in this place you call **World**
But here in your world,  they call me Prince,  from the noisy city of Lagos,  Nigeria.  Oh Lagos!  What a city!

## What Do I Do
Since it's impossible to freely ride dragons or fight dragon wars in this world of yours, I tooked to one of the mundane professions I deemed lovely enough, Hence,  I'm a **Graphics Designer**.
___
I love everything Art and Designs, that's what my entire being on this mundane planet is dedicated to. 
If I'm not riding my Dragon, I'm either working on a design or writing some great story 
###  What to expect from me
If you're a lover of fantasies, you've gotten yourself a new friend. I'll take you on a ride with me into my world of fantasy, where you get to meet those fierce and friendly creatures -the **Dragons**. 
You'll get to know about their world, their wars and their conquests and defeats. 
#### Is that all?... No
That's not all,  I'm a guy who has something for everyone, no matter who you are. I'll always have something interesting for you. 
As Graphics designer,  I'll be sharing with you awesome designs and how you can create them yourself. 
I'll be sharing with you beautiful adventure stories, fictions and myths. 
As an art lover, I'll make you see the beauties in art.  **Art is life**


___
# I hope me and **Draco** my dear dragon üêâ receives a warm welcome on Steemit. 
___
# We say thank you for dropping by. We're very glad to meet you, and we'll love to be your friend

I used Adobe Photoshop CS6 for the design. Below are the steps I took to arrive at the design :

___
After clicking on ""New Contribution"", an item on the list, the list won't Auto-hide as it should, thereby obstructing the screen.

![List not auto-hiding on Firefox.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513695173/y4txenmufgacwt2kpvhn.jpg)
The New Contribution link appears in color blue, which means it has been clicked on.

The error still occurred when  I tried with a different browser.

Steepshot Mobile App is that Instagram replacement(not even a competitor) people have been waiting for. 
But an important feature is missing from this great App, the video upload feature. 
It will be fantastic if the video upload feature could be added to Steepshot Mobile App .
___
Below is the default upload interface of Steepshot App, where users only have options to either take a photo with their phone's camera or upload photo from gallery 
![Screenshot_20171220-013015.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513734498/mchnkdwzbzuxvcfmwsxo.png)
___
I suggest we have something like this:
![Media Upload Layout.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513734552/grlbgfvgh0qrd2nm7hxg.jpg)


Whereby users have the options to either take a photo or record a video with the phone's camera,  or upload photo or video from gallery. 
___
I hope this much needed feature is added to Steepshot Mobile App soonest.

Good day,
First of all,  I will like to give kudos to the developers of The Steepshot Mobile App, they are really doing a great job. 
There is one essential feature that the Steepshot Mobile App doesn't have currently, Users can know the numbers of views their pictures garner .
It will be great if tte number of views a picture has gotten could be displayed on the steepshot Mobile App. 
###  Here is a screen grab of how posted pictures are currently displayed on the steepshot Mobile App 
![Views 1.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513853854/rlthyjnpgg3i2cqpffh0.jpg)

___

### I suggest we have something like this
![Views 2.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513853945/k0gbi02nkornbs5a7tsg.jpg)

___
### The number of views could also be represented by an eye icon like this:
![views 3.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513854050/the0hbyevbhfhfb274bi.jpg)
___
# Secondly
On the Steepshot Mobile App currently, users can't know the time left to payout of their posts. To know the estimated time left to payout, users have to log on to steemit. 
![Payout 1.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513855406/udilav4cdjtgikzbm4ru.jpg)
___

I want to suggest adding a feature to the Steepshot Mobile App such that when Users tap on the the value of money a particular picture has garnered, the estimated time left to payout will pop-up.
### I suggest we have something like this when the value of money of a post is tapped on on the App
![Payout 2.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513855548/rtn43dnbslowgzsrn1mg.jpg)

___
# Thirdly
I want to suggest that a feature is added to the steepshot Mobile App, whereby users can easily download pictures they like unto their phones' gallery. 
Currenty, users can't download photos from the Steepshot Mobile App unto their phone's. Adding this feature to the Steepshot Mobile App will allow users to save any particular photo they love or wish to have on their mobile phones easily
___
#### Currently if users tap on the three dot menu at the top of any photo on the App, we have this:
![save picture 1.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513856669/whvy54sfoodidpeg6qfg.jpg)

![Screenshot_20171220-013526.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513856705/qbbcchvhtb6axvbeuyux.png)

___
#### I suggest ""Save"" is added to the options, so that we have something like this:
![save picture 3.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513856796/a1gv2f1yr7uvp5gdrvr7.jpg)


___
###### This way,  users can easily download any photo of their choice. 

___
I hope the features are added very soon to the Steepshot Mobile App. 
Thanks

Good day, 
I want to suggest that a feature is added to the steepshot Mobile App, whereby users can easily download pictures they like unto their phones' gallery. 
Currenty, users can't download photos from the Steepshot Mobile App unto their phone's. Adding this feature to the Steepshot Mobile App will allow users to save any particular photo they love or wish to have on their mobile phones easily
___
#### Currently if users tap on the three dot menu at the top of any photo on the App, we have this:
![save picture 1.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513856669/whvy54sfoodidpeg6qfg.jpg)

![Screenshot_20171220-013526.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513856705/qbbcchvhtb6axvbeuyux.png)

___
#### I suggest ""Save"" is added to the options, so that we have something like this:
![save picture 3.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1513856796/a1gv2f1yr7uvp5gdrvr7.jpg)


___
###### This way,  users can easily download any photo of their choice. 
Thanks.

Good day, 
One of the much needed features of a photo sharing App is the photo editing feature. 
The Steepshot Mobile App as a photo sharing App is currently lacking this feature. 
There are no options to resize, apply filters, or balance the colors of the photos being shared on the steepshot Mobile App. 

Adding the Photo editing feature to the App will save users the stress of editing their pictures in other photo editing apps before being shared on the Steepshot Mobile App. 

___
#### I suggest users have something like this on the steepshot Mobile App when they want to upload their photos

Adding this feature will make the Steepshot Mobile App more endearing to the users and will also attract many more users to the Steepshot App and hence the Steem Blockchain. 
Thanks.

Good day, 
One of the essential features of the present day social media apps is the location tagging feature. 
It enables users not to only share their photos, videos and other contents but also their current locations.
For example, a user on vacation can easily post pictures of his vacation and tag his location so that friends and family will know where he is vacationing. 

The location tagging feature is not currently available on the steepshot Mobile App while posting. 

#### Here is what users have white posting o the App:

___
#### I suggest users have the ""Add Location"" option while posting on the steepshot Mobile App. Like this:

___
This way,  users will be to share their moments and location with friends. 

Thanks.

Good day, 
The Steepshot Mobile App as we know is built on the Steem blockchain. Since it is built on the the Steem blockchain, it is essential for users to be able to monitor their progress on the Steem blockchain on the App, hence the need to display the reputations of users on the App. 
Currently users reputation are not being displayed on the App, neither can users see/know the reputations of their followers. 
### This is what we have on the user profile of the Steepshot Mobile App 
![Screenshot_20171227-042155.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514344966/zfn5mcxobxg3clnuxkw3.png)

### I suggest that the user reputation is displayed this way on the app

Good day, 
The Schedule Posting Feature is an essential feature of the present day social media apps. 
All the existing social media platforms has this feature. The feature has a wide range of usability to the users. To users who use the media platform for their brand promotion, the scheduled posting feature helps spread their contents evenly over a specified period of time. 
The Scheduled posting feature is not currently available on the Steepshot Mobile App. Adding the feature to the App will help users who can't be publishing their contents regularly due to some factors to schedule their posts such that their contents will be posted at their desired time even when they are not available. 
#### The posting page of the Steepshot Mobile App looks like this currently

#### I suggest users have something like this while posting

This way, users will be able to schedule their posts to their desired date and time.

Good day, 
I want to suggest that two features are added to the Steepshot Mobile App. 

# Firstly, 
I want to suggest that the ""Private Account"" feature is added to the Steepshot Mobile App. Adding this feature to the App means that only followers of a any particular user can view his posted contents. This will go a long way in solving the problem of spammers making random comments of users posts, since only the users followers will see their posts, spammers will have no opportunity on making useless comments on users posts. 

### This is the default settings tab of the App:
![Screenshot_20171228-201711.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514497721/m9doiysnhqhkbge1zzgc.png)

### I suggest users have the option of making their accounts private like this:
![private account.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514497829/vycpihkcz4vq65h1rjbp.jpg)
___

# Secondly, 
I want to suggest that users Wallet are displayed on their profiles on the App, instead of the ""Account Balance"" being displayed currently on the App. 
The account balance being displayed can be confusing. It will be much better if users account worth in Steem Power, Steem and SBD are being displayed on the App separately. 

### This is how users account are being displayed currently on the App:

### I suggest that the users account worth is displayed this way on the app:
![Account worth (1).png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514498221/d3p2eabhxzxnb7demaok.jpg)

I hope this features are added to the Steepshot Mobile App soonest.

Good day,
I want to suggest that the post promotion feature is added to the steepshot Mobile App. This feature is a very essential feature that can help users reach a large audience with their posts.

The post promotion feature is an inevitable feature for users who want to promote their goods, services or brands via the Steepshot Mobile App. Without this feature, it will be practically impossible for them to reach a large audience. 
### Posts are being displayed currently on the App this way:
![Screenshot_20171229-035053.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514516947/knmoies9or1xsjhthabr.png)


I suggest that the ""Promote"" button is added beneath every posted photos or videos so that users can easily promote their contents on the App. 

### The promote button can be added this way:
![Promote.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514517018/cutpkqk3ngulmv95r0x6.jpg)
This way, users can easily tap on the promote button and pay stipulated amounts of money for their post promotion. 
Thanks.

At one point or the other, We've all made mistakes while posting our contents online. Be it typographical errors, using wrong tags, using different titles, and so on. All we just have to do is the edit the post and make necessay corrections -That is the beauty of the Post Editing feature,

Currently on the steepshot mobile app, this feature is not available. Users can't edit their posts once they tap on the ""publish"" button

Adding the post editing feature to the App will make it possible for the users to edit their posts and correct any error they might have committed while creating the posts.

# I suggest that the  ""Edit Post"" option is added to the ""three dot menu"" at the top of the posts
![Screenshot_2017-12-30-15-18-19 menu.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514665452/mabwinkhncwtwedi6xq6.jpg)

# Here are the current options available from the menu

# I suggest that the ""edit post"" option is added this way

___
This way, users will be able to edit their posts easily.
Thanks

I want to suggest that the New Followers Notification feature is added to the Steepshot Mobile App, such that users of the app are alerted whenever another user follows them.  This will enable the users to keep track of the number of their followers. 
The followers notification system is available on all other social media apps, adding this feature to the Steepshot Mobile App will also help the app keep up with its contemporaries. 
##### Currently, number of users' followers is displayed on their profile like this:

##### I suggest that users are notified by an indicator on their followers number to alert them that they have a new follower, this way:

This way, users will readily know whenever they have a new follower. 
Thanks.

The story feature is a feature common to all social media apps. The feature is very useful because every content the users share as a story will always be seen by all their followers because the stories are always pinned at the top of the feed. 

Adding the story feature to the Steepshot Mobile App will enable users share important contents or pass important information to all their followers such that none of their followers will miss the post because it will be pinned at the top of the feed. 

### The feed of the Steepshot Mobile App currently appears this way:

### I suggest that stories are displayed this way:
![Screenshot_20180102-131453.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1514895384/xqwzevrmljo8t05hjsdv.jpg)

This way,  users of the Steepshot Mobile App will be assured that all their followers will see their contents when the shared them as stories.

dragonrider,add-user-profile-editing-feature-to-rocket-chat-android-mobile-app,Add User Profile Editing Feature To Rocket.Chat Android Mobile App,utopian-io,"I want to suggest that a change is made in the Rocket.Chat Mobile App such that users of the app can easily edit their profiles on the App without logging on to the web app. 

Currently for users to edit their profiles, they have to access Rocket.Chat via the web. 
Adding this feature to the app will save the users the hassles of logging on to the web before they can edit their profiles. 

#### Currently when users tap on the drop-down menu in the app,  they only have options of changing their online status appearance or logging out

I suggest we have something like the Web App on the Mobile App, so that users can edit their profiles

This way, users will be able to edit their profiles on the Mobile App.

### The idea:
The idea behind the design is a play button at the edge of a clock to show that the clock is reading the play time. The bar chart at the centre of the clock represents statistics. I tried as much possible to let the logo really say much about. ""YouTube Watch History Statistics Viewer""

The logo is scalable and will look pretty good at any scale, no matter how small.

# Introduction
### What is Tag Following? 
Tag following is a feature in which users can follow a tag or tags of their interest just like they are following another user. 
When a user is following a particular tag,  any content posted under that tag will appear on his feed. 
For instance,  as a designer if I follow the #design tag,  every content posted with the ""design"" tag will automatically appear on my feed. Just like the contents of other users I'm following are shown on my feed. 

# Why is the tag following feature essential? 
Adding the Tag Following feature to the Steepshot Mobile App will save users the hassles of having to go through ""search"" to browse through their tags of interest. The feature will bring users' tags of interest right into their feeds. 

## Suggested design:
When users search for a tag,
they should have the option of following the tag as shown.

___
I hope the tag following feature is added to the Steepshot Mobile App soonest so that users can easily follow their tags of interest. 
Thanks

dragonrider,increase-the-maximum-size-of-file-that-can-shared-on-the-rocket-chat-mobile-app,Increase The Maximum Size of File That Can Shared On The Rocket.Chat Mobile App,utopian-io,"# Introduction 
One of the most important features of mobile messenger apps is their file sharing abilities. 
Users can easily send pictures, gif images, voice notes and others. The file sharing feature makes communication much more better and interesting. 

# The Problem
![Screenshot_20180105-233910.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1515240471/hfrcg8dmxrycbfhfiojz.jpg)

Currently, the Rocket.Chat Mobile App only supports a maximum of 2MB file transfer which is not that useful for the users because a picture (one of the most shared file type) of a good quality has an average size of 3.5MB, other files such as PDFs, and videos even has higher sizes. This makes the 2MB maximum file transfer limit render the file sharing feature of the Rocket.Chat Mobile App close to being useless. 

# My Suggested Solution 
I suggest that the developers work on the Rocket.Chat Mobile App to increase the maximum size of file that can be shared on the App to something like 15MB. This way,  users can easily share files and communicate effectively on the App. 
Thanks.

___

An equalizer is a component of an audio player that allows the amplification or reduction of a particular sound frequency.
___
#### Why Is It Essential To Be Added To Vanilla Music Player? 
Adding an equalizer to vanillar music player will give users the opportunity to adjust the frequency of the audio produced by the music player to their taste. 
For instance, users who love high bass can adjust the equalizer to boost the bass. Users call also adjust the equalizer to produce various effects such as rock,  heavy metal, classic, hip-hop, etc.

# Introduction 
Many a times when users are listening to music on a music player app,  they fall in love with a particular song and want to immediately set it as their ring tone.

This is when the ""set as ring tone"" feature comes handy on music player apps. This feature enables users of a music player app to set the current playing song as their ringtone right inside the app. Unfortunately, this feature is not available on Timbre Player. 

# Why is the ""set as ring tone"" feature essential to Timber player? 
Adding this feature to Timber player will save users the hassles of going through file manager to search for a particular song before they can set it as their ringtone. It will enable them set any song of their choice as the ringtone right in Timber Player. 

# My Suggestion 
I suggest that the ""Set as ringtone"" option is added to the options on the drop-down menu of Timber Player.

With the inception of location tagging on cameras and camera apps on mobile phones, it is now possible tag pictures taken at particular location with the location name. With the location tagging features on cameras and camera apps came the ""sort by location"" option on most gallery apps. 
# What Is ""Sort By Location"" Feature 
Present on almost  all the gallery viewer apps of the present day, the sort by location options groups all pictures with the same location tag together so that  that they can be viewed together as if they the pictures were in the same folder.
Currently on the Camera Roll App,  the sort by location option is not available. There are only three sorting options,  sort by name, size or date![Screenshot_20180110-205644.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1515618638/gw5ph7gfmcznggxgcgfx.jpg)

#### Introduction 
One of the most widely used and popular document format is the PDF format. Most users prefer their documents to be in the .pdf format due it's versatility and portability. 

#### The Problem 
Currently, OpenDocument Reader does not support the PDF format,  making it impossible for users of the app to view their documents which are in the .pdf on the App. 
If users try to open a PDF file on the App, the following error pops up
![Screenshot_20180112-190804.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1515781501/fb0euqcw1sdbbtezikhc.jpg)


#### My Suggestion 
I want to suggest that OpenDocument Reader
 is made to support the .pdf file format like the document viewer below.  So that users can easily open and view their PDF files on the App. 
![Screenshot_20180112-193509.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1515782161/v8vzwzekzrwtizqtxud4.jpg)

#### Benefits
Adding the .pdf file support to OpenDocument Reader will make it possible for users for users to open and edit their PDF files on the App, and hence increase the number of users of the App and also the popularity of the App.

dragonrider,add-photo-editing-feature-to-camera-roll-app,Add Photo Editing Feature To Camera Roll App,utopian-io,"#### Intro
The photo editing feature is an integral and indispensable feature of a good camera and gallery app. This feature makes it easy for users to edit their images on the go on the camera/gallery app. 

#### The Problem  
Currently users can not edit their photos in the Camera Roll App, The only editing users can do on the App is to resize their images. Users can't do real editing like adding filters to their images, adjusting the brightness and exposure, adding frames, etc. 
###### When  users open an image on the Camera Roll App and tap on the edit icon, they are directed to choose which app they want to choose for the editing, if they select the Camera Roll App, the only task they can perform is to resize the image:

#### My Suggestion 
I want to suggest that a good inbuilt image editor is added to the Camera Roll App, such that users can edit their images; apply filters, make colour corrections, etc, right on the App. 
##### Like this editor on a gallery app:

#### Benefits
Adding an inbuilt photo editor to Camera Roll App will make it easy for users perform editing tasks right on the App without the hassles of launching a third party app for their image editing.
This feature will also help grow the user base of the App because it will encompass everything users want from a gallery app. 
Thanks.
