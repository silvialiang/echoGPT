> Life has no meaning the moment you lose the illusion of been eternal because the moment you get a meaning to your life, you don't want to go back. You want to proceed.- Akinola Philip

A man's life should never be built on fear because once you allow fear into your life, you lose hold of the control over your  life and things that makes life worth living.

Fear simply means:
**F- False
E- Experience
A- Appearing
R- Real**

It is an element found in people who are not ready to take the best out of life. Fear draws one back and rips man of his right in life. Fear is one thing a man of vision should avoid. It is a cankerworm that destroys the totality of life even before its conception.

For a man that is striving or determined to succeed in life, there are some specific things to note and","{""tags"":[""motivation"",""life"",""people"",""nigeria"",""africa""],""image"":[""https://thumb7.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/1350646/593986727/stock-photo-closeup-on-businessman-holding-a-card-with-text-face-your-fears-business-concept-image-with-soft-593986727.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmYeAMoemhSd4fFnHTHC4175xxNYYD6qHSAf9nCKBX2KzZ/images(4).jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmRhDtjokAZnGKi4QwheqksKTFo6m4fsjMYsNNrsitC1xk/DQmRhDtjokAZnGKi4QwheqksKTFo6m4fsjMYsNNrsitC1xk.gif""],""links"":[""https://www.google.com/search?q=face+your+fears&client=firefox-b&dcr=0&tbm=isch&prmd=ivns&ei=2PC2WdrCDM_EwALj8Z2oBw&start=40&sa=N#mhpiv=3&spf=1505161450801""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-09-11 20:53:15,Facing your fears is a needed trait for progression.,/motivation/@vhktor/facing-your-fears-is-a-needed-trait-for-progression,0

**What is my worth?**
Take your time, digest the question and answer it to yourself. Worth in this context is not about material possession, It is how you feel about yourself, that which you think of yourself.

Do you see yourself as a Success or Failure?

Do you see yourself as a Victor or a Loser?

We should all know that our thoughts and believes about ourselves contributes to the kind of person we are. We live what we think and our thought goes a long way in our life. What we actually think of ourselves is very important to our well being or to achieving our goals. You can't see yourself as a future and think you can actually be successful because the moment you feel or think you are a failure you quit trying to be a success, you feel why run when you already have a winner. 

This feeling of low self esteem might be as a result of previous occurrence in one's life probably you've had some experience which made you feel you can't make ","{""tags"":[""motivation"",""people"",""life"",""nigeria"",""africa""],""image"":[""https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/06/23/08/55/board-2433978__340.jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmRhDtjokAZnGKi4QwheqksKTFo6m4fsjMYsNNrsitC1xk/DQmRhDtjokAZnGKi4QwheqksKTFo6m4fsjMYsNNrsitC1xk.gif""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-09-12 21:27:12,Appreciate Yourself,/motivation/@vhktor/appreciate-yourself,0

He told me Steemit is a social media like Reddit that rewards me for my simply by writing and sharing my view of life or everything around which was more or less what I've been doing on social media like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter for fun without any thought of being rewarded.

My heart leaped for joy when I was finally told there is a social medium that actually rewards me for my content. I was amazed and happy not only for the reward but because the thought of connecting and meeting a new set of people has always excited me.

## Hunter's comment
Many are times you will think of what to do at a more leisure time and you won't find any other option than to relax the brain a little.
