The central concern for this study stands for the euro- centric submission that Africa has no history and that the only history about Africa were the activities of the European of our shores. It was advanced by this same European that such activities are colonialism, slavery and missionary are the platforms upon which the western civilization and culture thrive and sustain.
	
However, the extreme purpose of this study is to show that Western civilization and culture are precariously contaminated in traditional values of Africa, and to further prove that Africa had established well before the advent of colonialism a pattern of homegrown political system governance process and generally acceptable institutional rulemaking arrangement such that there was progression in the race of civilization of Africa and self-styled tempo to technological arrangement of development.

The problem with first time reporters, like first year undergraduate essay writers is that they try to impress their readers rather than to inform them. They always tend to forget that not everybody who will read their story has been reading the same books they have read, or acquired the same vocabulary they have.

Often times, the writer even forgets that his readers do not always go about with dictionaries in their pocket, and more. More do not have the inclination nor the time to look up for meaning of words when reading their newspapers or bulletins. One of the major problem the novice writer has to overcome is the urge to impress, the urge to show ''high standard"" of the command of English language, to show that the writer is knowledgeable although, he may actually not know much.

However, it should be noted that news consumers are always in a hurry, they don't want to pay for information the","{""tags"":[""life"",""writing"",""story"",""onequality"",""afro-naija""],""users"":[""dammylohar""],""image"":[""https://steemitimages.com/DQmS6FZjk1ZbB5C4kyZzNnSa4Zdth8ZgopmdPi1ZXq2KZTp/images%20(19).jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmezC2EdY5abLrtq7fkA1YZxYEQgJQ4Bey4GnY1sbtJPPf/images%20(20).jpg"",""https://steemitimages.com/DQmZnmpYpivDHVjmNFKSi3cmK5CXP3UctrYfhMY6Ngzt62F/download%20(1).png""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2017-05-30 15:41:45,Why Do You Write?,/life/@dammylohar/why-do-you-write,14

The first is calculated based on our date of birth; the second is determined by the health conditions; the third is how old we feel we are.

<p>1. Seagaia Beach, Japan</p>
<p>Seagaia Beach is located in Japan. Ocean Dome Seagaia is a part of the Japanese Sheraton Seagaia Resort. It is an artificial beach, which can accommodate up to 10,000 visitors. It stretches 300 meters long and 100 meters wide. The air temperature is always maintained at 30 degrees Celsius, and the water temperature is 28 degrees. Built-in imitative volcano is periodically making waves for surfers to ride. Also in bad weather an artificial roof rises, that provides the sunny sky.</p>

<p>NOTE:The atomic number is the number is the number of protons in the nucleus which equals the number of electrons in &nbsp;the atom.</p>
<p>H G moseley suggested in 1913 that the multiple charge on the nucleus arose from the presence of protons,which contribute the charge. Since atoms are neutral,the number of electrons must be the same as the number of protons. Atomic masses are greater than the mass of the protons in the atom. To make up the extra mass, the existence of neutrons was postulated.These particles should have the same mass as proton and zero charge.The search for the neutron began.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>NOTE: neutrons have mass but no charge</p>

<p>The idea that matter consists of atoms dates from ancient times.</p>
<p>chemistry is the study of how matter behaves.one of the oldest ideas in science is that matter can be divided and futher divided into smaller and smaller particles until eventually that smallest possible particles are obtained; these particles cannot be further divided.This idea was put forward by the greek philosopher democritus in 400BC. He called the particles atom(Greek:atomos,indivisible).This early idea was not based on experimental result and did not influence science.</p>
<p>Atom is the smallest indivisible,indistruable particle of an element.</p>

<p>The report, released January 12 by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in Washington, D.C., calls for expanding research on potential medical applications of cannabis and its products, including marijuana and chemical components called cannabinoids.</p>
<p>Big gaps in knowledge remain about health effects of cannabis use, for good or ill. Efforts to study these effects are hampered by federal classification of cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Schedule 1 status makes it difficult for researchers to access cannabis.</p>

<p>Tilikum, the captive orca who killed a trainer at SeaWorld in Orlando, Fla., in 2010 and later became the subject of the documentary “Blackfish,” died on Friday.</p>

<p>The whale had been suffering from a persistent infection from a bacteria found in wild habitats and natural settings, but the exact cause of death will be determined by a necropsy, SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment said in a statement.

<p>&nbsp;THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION</p>
<p>Charles Darwin made a number of observations in many parts of the world and put forth the law of natural selection involving struggle for existence and survival of the fittest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Variation leads to genetic diversity,which is the staircase of evolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Evolution</p>
<p>Evolution may be defined as a gradual development of more complex species from pre-existing simpler forms.</p>
<p>It is an extremely slow process and has been occuring since millions of years, as revealed by fossil evidence.</p>
<p>Evolution has thus resulted in the diversity &nbsp;of &nbsp;organisms, &nbsp;influenced &nbsp;by environmental selection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Human Evolution</p>

<p>&nbsp;VARIATION</p>
<p>All around us, we see different organisms belonging to different species, differing from one another. Variation may be defined as differences in the characteristics among the individuals of the same species,&nbsp;</p>
<p>(A) &nbsp;Intra &nbsp;specific &nbsp;variationor among the different genera</p>
<p>(B) Intergeneric variation or among different species &nbsp;</p>
<p>(C) &nbsp;Inter specific &nbsp;variation.No two individuals are identical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asexual reproduction produces very closely resembling offspring. Asexual reproduction thus results in offspring with minor</p>
<p>variations. Sexually reproducing organisms produce offspring with marked, significant and visible variations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Types of Variations</p>
<p>a. Somatic Variation - It pertains to body cells and it is not inherited.</p>
<p>b. Germinal &nbsp;Variation - It pertains to germ cells or gametes and it is inheritable. It leads to speciation and evolution.</p>

<p>Eyo festival</p>
<p>The Eyo Festival, otherwise known as the Adamu Orisha Play, is a Yoruba festival unique to Lagos, Nigeria. In modern times, it is presented by the people of Lagos as a tourist event and, due to its history, is traditionally performed on Lagos Island.</p>
<p>History of Eyo Festival</p>
<p>history has it that the Eyo masquerade is not original to Lagos Island but was brought there sometimes around 1750 by two unnamed personalities from Ibefun and Ijebu communities in present day Ogun State. Owing to the fascinating appeal, they succeeded in introducing it as part of interment rites of passage for the departing Oba at that time, Oba Ado who is believed to have married one of their cousins, Olugbani.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another version has it that the main deity Adamu Orisha originated from Ibefun just as Eyo masquerade came as a result of the need to protect the deity from the activities of hooligans who might seek to destroy or steal it.</p>

<p>What is Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a payment system introduced as open-source software in 2009 by developer Satoshi Nakamoto. The payments in the system are recorded in a public ledger using its own unit of account, which is also called bitcoin. Payments work peer-to-peer without a central repository or single administrator, which has led the US Treasury to call bitcoin a decentralized virtual currency. Although its status as a currency is disputed, media reports often refer to bitcoin as a cryptocurrency or digital currency.</p>
<p>Bitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments into the public ledger. Called mining, individuals or companies engage in this activity in exchange for transaction fees and newly created bitcoins. Besides mining, bitcoins can be obtained in exchange for fiat money, products, and services. Users can send and receive bitcoins electronically for an optional transaction fee using wallet so","{""tags"":[""cn"",""writing"",""curauto"",""bitcoin"",""life""],""app"":""steemit/0.1"",""format"":""html""}",2016-12-09 00:17:48,BITCOIN AND AXPO,/cn/@dammylohar/bitcoin-and-axpo,2

<p>Salto is not the highest-jumping robot out there — some bots can jump to heights of more than 10 feet (3 meters), but those bots have to wind up for several minutes before they leap, whereas Salto can jump again almost immediately, the researchers said. This allows the one-legged bot to push off a wall — much like human parkour enthusiasts — to gain height more quickly, they added.&nbsp;</p>
