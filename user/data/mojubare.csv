He was a stranger. I got down and thanked him again. I began to walk towards the gate.
Just when I was pushing the gate open, I heard his voice saying, you didn't tell me your name, he hollered.
That's because you didn't ask, I hollered back.

So what is your name, he asked.
I tittered even though I felt awkward that he was talking from a distane and I was reluctant to go to him. I thought if he was not arrogant, he would come down and come over to me.

"" I even think that I am the only one that is suffering this. I didn't even know that they are doing the same thing to you. This is not how our fathers were treated by the people. The people are now becoming stingy and ungrateful.

""I have thought about this severally and I even said that I will come to your lace to know if you are observing the same thing."" Said Ijoka.

My forefather who practice this priest of a thing did not lack anything. There was adequate and surplus food for them from the people. But in our turn the people has become stingy. They refuse to bring thanksgiving offerings to the gods. Do they even think that they were making greatness by their own power and wisdom?

Upon the orientation, I've being passing, trying to stir them to pay thanksgivings to the gods yet all that I said fell on deaf ears. Do they want us to perish to hunger? it has come to a stage that I can't even find meat in my soup anymore. Ijoka the second priest is also complaining of the some thing. 

I think it is time to do something. What shall i do to get rich? should I inflict them with pains snd sicknesses. After a deep thought, he knew that wasn't possible.

""My husband here is your food,"" she said to Isiaja. ""Have the children eaten?"" Isiaja asked her. ""Yes, my husband"" she replied and went away.

Isiaja opened the soup and the soup was pale with not soup at all, no crayfish, meat or snail. there was nothing at all. He looked up and down and shook his head uncontrollably.

After the sacrifice, the people promised to keep the kingship for his lineage only. Ever since king Ukanna lineage has been ruling the Ijoko Kingdom. Before the festival was stopped, anytime is was the festive period, people usually envy the priests and most people wanted to be priests.

One day, Isiaja was in his house and he was moody and worried. Isisaja was the head chief priest of Ijoko Kingdom. There were two chief priests in Ijoko KIngdom that the people go to for enquiries.

At the last day of that month the people of Ijoko will then bring their sacrificial items to the gods and offered by the people to their bns. The cheif priest of that time never lack foods, whether there is famine in the land or not, it does not concern them. 

No one dared question the chief priests or accused them of anything because th practice has been revealed from different chief priests from different kingdoms that the festival was from the gods and not the chief priests that manipulated it.

It was said that the festival was a punishment to the kingdom for what their anscestors did against the gods. So king Ukanna offered his daughter as a sacrifice to the gods. aHe doesn't want to bother anyoneor ask his people to provide the virgin girl for the sacrifice.

The chief priest was good to his people and was not in support of that sudden and strange tradition even before his appointment as chief priest. He was the one who gave the king the idea of where he can get solution for his people but he told him that it was not a small task.

The chief priest was not after the riches the gods has given through that practice rather he was concerned with the happiness of the people.

The king was the only person eligible by tradition to embark on such journey. The previously passed chief refused to unveil the measure on which that strange tradition will be abolished because the tradition was for their interest.

This practice lingered until when a brave king emerged from the kingdom. His name was Ukanna. During his reign as king, he arose to seek measures to put an end to the unusual festival they were observing that made the people in the kingdom unhappy.

When the people attempted to violate the festival by foresaking it, calamity will visit the land thereby calling for appeasement of the gods. The practice continued for 10 years until king Ukanna left hie kingdom to seek solution and relief for the people in his kingdom. King Ukanna on his return came back with two bulls from the land of the spirits which he sacrificed as he was commanded and the strange custom  ends. 

King Ukenna was formally a warrior in the land of Ijoko. During the 10 years of king Ukanna's vacation, the throne was empty and nobody was recrowned king.

The kingdom of Ijoko has been a serene place to live. The people of the kingdom had been living in peace, harmony and unity. The people have breathed the breath of relief and comfort for the past 3 century when their ancestors were subjected to a particular festivity which was imposed by their gods.



The festival is meant to be an annual occasion and observed two times in a year, where the entire people gather 30% of their farm produce and offer it to the chief priests as sacrificial items to the gods for two quarters of the year. Soon the chief priests became rich as so many people brought 30% of the chief priests. 

The chief priest became the wealthest people in the kingdom as they were been enriched by the villagers.

At the beginning, everyone (lovers) tend to do everything the right way, they do not find mistakes in all they do.

They enjoy their first part of the relationship but then they get to the next face where they start seeing each other's flaws and then they start taking things too personally.

Knowing your right is a different thing, carefully laying it out is another thing. This same thing goes as far as relationships, friendships and so on. So many people might be right and be sincere, in fact, you might offend someone but the manner in which the person will relate the issue might make them wrong.

Kings are associated with kingly life and glory. Kings are not meant to transgress in judgement which means that a king is not meant to tell lies or how respect for anyone while judging. A king ought not to be biased or partial during judgment. A king is not meant to steal or make rules when intoxicated.

Have you taken time to imagine a world without youth, that means there will be a world without a future because youths are the future. If there is a nation without youth, then there is a nation without a vision, a nation without a drive. Youths are the evidence of a productive past and a prosperous future. A nation without youth will be less active, vibrant and it will be dull.

## Who are youths?
Youths are people not of the same age group and range. They are young adults with strength, the ability to do adventures that lack the experience of matured humans. Youth is said to be the transition stage between childhood and adulthood. Although some people believe that being a youth does not have anything to do with age, rather it has to do with having a heart and mind of continuous progress which is also called hope. It is believed that youths are known to be filled with hope and at that they have a growing mind.

mojubare,the-word,The Word,christianity,"There are some important things to note. In Act 20:32, 1Peter 4: 11, Apostle Paul was commending the bredren to God and to the word of his grace, in essence, he was departing from them to go elsewhere in his missionary assignment, and he had confidence that God and his word would take care of the saints in Ephesus. He knew and believed that God's word was enough to sustain them.

Humans now take time to observe the packaging, label, expiry date and most especially ingredients before buying a product. We prefer foods not stored with chemical preservatives to foods stored with chemical preservatives and that brought about the use of High-Pressure Processing Technology. The ability to preserve food at the same time reduce pathogen without compromising the nutritional or organoleptic properties of the food has been the research for scientist and manufacturers.

With the coronavirus pandemic, a lot of people have been worried about how to get goods from China as well as send goods to china via cargo. Analysts have predicted that there might be an economic recession due to the outbreak and the Chinese government in other to set things back to normal have asked citizens to go back to work but yet the economy seems paused. Let’s agree that the citizens decides to go back to work, how many foreign persons will risk their lives on a cargo to get goods from china when there is a possibility that they might contact the virus. This is the point you wish everything can be automated from production to shipping, as well as transporting. With that I guess automated shipping would have been of help to transport goods from china to any other of the world.
