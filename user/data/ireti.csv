Either you are starting as a small store, shop or a big company or industry, there are a lot of things you need to know and learn in other not to go out of business before the end of the first year. In other to have your business go the way you expect it to go, one thing you need to do is to deal with decision makers not decision killers.

I went for a friends birthday party some years ago, it was a strictly by invitation party and was attended by only those who were with their invitation card.

My bosom friend was the person doing the birthday and she had instructed the security that whoever did not have the Invitation card with their name inscribed on it should not be allowed in.

There are a lot of people who go through pain but then they have to fake a smile to deceive people that they are happy. 
I think sometimes it is good you allow your true emotions show,  this will make it possible for people to know how you really feel and when they should come into the picture to assist.
But when you are sad and you appear to be happy, everyone will think you are indeed happy and require no assistance whatsoever.

which is usually a painful experience,
because they will give all and then get nothing back in return.
