In most cases, the reason for implementation of tariffs and quotas on imports could be to improve locally produced products, to fight against discrimination against a foreign country in the trade market, to serve as a warning to a foreign country that the local country is still the economic and trade power for the foreign country.

The scalpers are traders who make profit from the bid and ask margin willing to go with the little profit made from their trades. The scalpers are always on the market waiting for every rise and watching every drop, they are always setting prices that will fetch little profits per trade which accumulates after several trades.

The Speculators are traders who trade for long-term. They trade with the hope to profit from the commodity price at a long run. They speculate for a longer time unlike that of the scalpers.

Hedgers are mostly companies trying to hedge a product which is very valuable to their product. They stay on the market so as to keep the price stable and prevent unnecessary rise in price.

Living life is a big task but so many of us do not know this. A lot of people believe that their life is being controlled by one outside force or person, they believe that their way of life is being determined by others.

This mindset has turned a lot of people to living liabilities as they spend most of their life doing absolutely nothing but live the day as it comes by. They use every minute of their life doing nothing or living for others. 

Some years back, a man was found sitting on a bench along the road. He was holding a small clock and was raising his head up and down at every tick. He did this continuously and he was counting 19975,  19976, ..... He did this continuously and I was forced to ask him why he did this he said to me.

Even those who work from home are not left out of the laziness to perform household chores, but through all the stress, we can now smile because technology once again has come through for us.

There are various technological instruments that makes household chores an easy task to perform but this time around there are even robots that carry out the assigned task while you do not have to lift a finger ( that sounds interesting right?), so read through as I tell you more about this fascinating helpers.

In my previous post I talked about email marketing and I am glad you all liked it, I want to say a big thank you to everyone that keeps reading my post and to the @project.hope community for being supportive. Without no further delay and still on marketing and advertising, I will be looking at something virtually everyone is used to which is online advertisement.

You must have seen several pop ups from different companies and businesses trying to create an awareness about what they do while you are surfing the internet. In short and simple terms, Online advertisement is showcasing, making awareness and publicity of products, companies and businesses to the general public or their audience in other to cause an increase in sales. The major purpose of an advertisement either online or offline is to create awareness and to get positive response from their audience.

Before the internet boom and the year of technology, a simple post of “building for sale” on a stick board or a simple advert on the left corner of a newspaper was enough to get influx people and calls asking about the building but all this have changed. Everything has changed, if you do this now, you might not find a buyer. Realtor.com says that about 80% of buyers search for homes online and this goes down to other aspect of business. Unlike some years back when people make adverts through papers and bills, now every business is going online.
